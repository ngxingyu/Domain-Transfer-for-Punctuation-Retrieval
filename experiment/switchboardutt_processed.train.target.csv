Does it say something? think it usually does. You might try, uh, don't know, hold it down a little longer, and see if it, uh, Okay . Well, Okay I, Does it usually make a recording or s-, Well, don't remember. It seemed like it did, but it might not. guess … Okay. … guess we can start. Uh, Okay. No, don't, don't have any kids. I, uh, my sister has a, she just had a baby, he's about five months old and she was worrying about going back to work and what she was going to do with him and … Uh-huh. … the different, do you have kids? have three. Oh, really? Uh-huh. Yeah, do . Yes, uh, don't work, though, but used to work and, when had two children. Uh-huh. work off and on just temporarily and usually find friends to babysit, but don't envy anybody who's in that situation to find day care. Yeah. But, does your sister live in a big community? Uh, yeah she lives, it's a, it's a fairly large community. She, uh, got real lucky, though. He had a boss who, uh, moved into a larger office … Uh-huh. … and she's able to take her baby to work with her. Oh, really? And it's a small office that she works in … Uh-huh. … and, uh, it's a, it's a legal firm, office, and it's just one lawyer … Um. … and so she's the only one really that takes care of the office. There's no one else that works there. Uh-huh. And so they have an extra room and everything for the baby, so it works out pretty good for her. Wow. How lucky . I, know a lot of people around here sometimes have, like, mothers or grandmothers … Yeah. … that take care of their kids and, but, the community I'm in is not a real large one, so there are a lot of people who babysit in their homes that, you know, you either know them or know somebody who knows them , to get to, Yeah, so it's fairly safe. Yeah, to get references and that, so, but, uh, I, d-, don't feel comfortable about leaving my kids in a big day care center, but, simply because there's so many kids and so many , Worried that they're not going to get enough attention? Yeah, and, uh, you know, colds and things like that get … Yeah. … spread real easy and things, but, and they're expensive and, course, there's a lot of different types of day care available, too, you know, where they teach them academic things. Yes. Or they just watch them and let them play and things like that, but, take a long time to find the right place . Yeah, and you, and you don't always even know if it's, it's going to be the right place or not."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0001_4325.utt,"Uh-huh. Anything, guess, could happen. Uh-huh. Because after, guess after he, you know, gets to a certain age she's going to have to take him to a day care. Uh-huh, when he starts toddling around and stuff. Yeah. Yeah. When, when he's not, when she can't keep control of him and he starts crawling that's, Uh-huh. It would be hard, think it would be kind of stressful. It would be nice to have him around … Uh-huh. … but, uh, seems like, you know, goll-, what if he cried at the wrong time or the phone rang or,. you know, at the wrong time . Yeah. But, think she has problems with that, too. Uh-huh. Well, when you have kids, will you work? Do you … don't know … work now? … that's something I've considered. Uh, Uh-huh. always kind of think it would be neat to be able to watch them and be there for them all the time. Uh-huh. Is that what you do? Uh, yeah. Actually, teach my kids at home, so I'm here all the time. Oh, so they don't go to school. Is it like, uh, oh, what's that called, it's, uh, correspondence school, they do it … Uh-huh. … at home. Yeah, yeah. That's interesting. So, Do you have to have any special training? Not, it depends on the state you live actually. Some laws absolutely prohibit it. Some states, uh, say that you have to be a certified teacher in order to do that. Our state doesn't yet, say that and I'm not a certified teacher. went to college, but I, you know, but my kids are only elementary grades, levels right now and so, So they haven't been to public schools at all. One of them was for a couple of years and so, you know, my oldest, he was, and then my youngest two have never been. Um."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0002_4330.utt,"Well, uh, does the company you work for test for drugs? Actually, uh, they just recently started a policy of testing drugs, which was kind of interesting, because w-, when went to work for them, uh, they didn't do that, but, uh, since then they've, they've started a drug testing policy, not because of their own, uh, convictions, but because the clients of our company are requests that we do that. Huh. How about you? Uh, no, we're not being tested for drugs at all, uh, our policies and procedures manual, uh, the furthest it goes about drugs is in the, kind of the miscellaneous section, or … Uh-huh. … it's reasons for immediate dismissal, it says, use of narcotics on company premises. Um. So that's pretty general, but, uh, work for an environmental management firm … Okay. … and I'm an engineer there, but do go on a lot of hazardous waste sites, but don't operate any machinery. Yeah. Now, people for our company that do operate machinery like drill rigs and things like that … Uh-huh. … are under a, a medical monitoring program, because they're at a higher risk of exposure and blood screening is part of that and I, think that drugs, they do test for drugs in that capacity, but it's not their exclusive, it's just part, it's just something that turns up in the other parameters that they test for. Yeah. But think it's got a little more relevance since they are around dangerous equipment and things like that and do have to exercise some quick judgment in the field. What is the nature of your company's business? Well, it's actually, uh, we do oil well services. So, a lot of our clients are oil companies, big oil companies, and they go out to, we have engineers who, uh, go out to the oil well, to the, to the client's oil well, and, and work with a lot of heavy equipment and put tools down the oil well and stuff, so the clients are very concerned that, you know, the engineers who go out there are adhering to their drug policy, because they're on their, their, you know, territory and everything, but … Um. … the thing that's interesting is that w-, I'm an engineer and, a software engineer and work in the software, uh, house, and everybody there, you know, are all software engineers. They've never, you know, they never go out to the, the oil rigs or anything, and yet, we're getting, we're subjected to this policy, you know, the same one that, uh, th-, all the engineers have to, to, well, a little different, actually, but, uh, you know, we have to go through the same thing, and it's, but it's, uh, it's a little different, guess than , than a lot of drug policies."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0002_4330.utt,"In our case, it's like, when you hire on, they'll test you, and then if you get injured on the job, if you like trip and fall or something, uh, they give you a drug test right away. Oh, really? Other than that they don't have random testing or anything like that, but, a lot of people were really upset with the policy at first. Particularly, like , uh, we have a lot of parties and stuff where they serve alcohol, and tha-, they didn't find any problem with that, you know, but, Right. Uh, We, that's been an, a, an issue, uh, in our company even though we don't have the random or even regular drug screening. In fact , they'll have these little parties, and people will just get, I mean, I've, my brother lives where work, and have many a time called him to come get me, you know. And, uh, uh, but, y-, you know, they don't think twice about serving beer by the keg. Yeah . You know, but, uh, think drug testing, and I, don't know, guess k-, think it's got some relevance, but think its relevance is pretty limited. I mean, think, you know, in your case, don't think that you should necessarily be subjected to drug testing. Yeah. think that's an interesting policy your company has about testing immediately after an on the job accident. Yeah, it's really, it's really bizarre. Uh, particularly, like where we are, you know. I, I, there was a story of a woman last year who, who actually did slip on the ice and, and like sprained her ankle and she, she was a personnel secretary and she had to get tested and, don't know I'm ambivalent about the whole thing. I, you know, have a lot of mixed feelings about on the one hand, it's like if, you know, they're, they should be able to make it as a continue of employment in some sense and, you know, it's like you're, I mean, employments are contractual by nature anyway … Uh-huh. … but, uh, had an experience when was interviewing for a job that, where had to, uh, uh, do a drug test and, and it's, it was kind of a long story, but it was, it was just an incredibly humiliating experience what went through, and it amounted to, uh, going in, uh, before any of these interviews, I'm not even working for this company, I'm going in for, like, interviews and they flew me out to Chicago and, and, uh, before went into any of the interviews, uh, they took me to the doctor to give me a physical. They said it was going to be a physical, you know, and, uh, actually bec-, beforehand they told me they were going to, uh, do drug screening, but had forgotten about that, and so, basically, I'd already peed off in that morning and, and when got in there, didn't, wasn't, like, able to give a full sample, and so …"
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0002_4330.utt,"Oh. … they made me sit and wait for forty-five minutes, drink a whole ton of water … Right. … before went to any of the interviews and go in there again, and the, and the, the procedure is utterly humiliating. You go in there with the doctor, he makes you take off all your clothes and then he examines you."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0003_4103.utt,"Uh, the question was kind of interesting to me because was just trying to put together a, uh, long term financial plan and monthly budget. The only thing do now is, uh, put the data into Quicken. don't know if you are familiar with that. Yeah, have some friends of mine who use Quicken and, uh, I've considered using it once myself, but decided that the amount of information that would have to go in would be a lot of time keeping that up to date. Uh-huh. So I, kind of gave up on the idea of using Quicken, at least for now. Um. I've found it's the only reliable way to keep a check book balanced actually because what will happen is my wife will write a few checks and then, well, uh, uh, not bother to total it … Uh-huh. … and then it comes in to doing all the arithmetic. So it really helps with that. Yeah, well, it's similar problems but, uh, we just have the one check book and we try to keep it up to date as much as possible and occasionally we will get behind like you say but, uh, it doesn't really seem to be too, too tight if we just remember to keep everything up, up to date and balanced. Uh-huh. Well, how to you handle that, the long range or medium range planning on finances? Well, actually we haven't had to. Uh, until just recently. guess we've got a, a daughter who is eighteen months and another one on the way so … Uh-huh. … we needed to start doing more of that just for, uh, you know, saving for college and things like that. We tried a way, try to put away two and four thousand a year just for that. Yeah. Well that's pretty good if you can do that. know. have a daughter who's ten and we haven't really put much away for her college up to this point but, uh, we're to the point now where our financial income is enough that we can consider putting some away … Uh-huh. … for college, so we are going to be starting a regular payroll deduction … Um. … in the fall and then the money that will be making this summer we'll be putting away for the college fund. Um. Sounds good. Yeah, guess we're, we're just at the point, uh, my wife worked until we had a family and then, you know, now we're just going on the one income so it's … Uh-huh. … a lot more interesting trying to, uh, find some extra payroll deductions is probably the only way we will be able to, uh, do it. You know, kind of enforce the savings. Uh-huh. But, uh, it will be interesting to see . Well our situation is just a little bit, kind of the opposite of that cause my wife was not working for some time and was going to school and just recently, uh, took on a full time job, well almost full time."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0003_4103.utt,"Um. So, it's only recently that we've had the money where we could start putting away large sums of it for, uh, long range goals like college and sickness and … Um. … travel and that kind of thing. That sounds good. But, uh, uh, was just curious, what, uh, part of the country. Oh, Stockton. Oh, okay. How about you? Uh, Cincinnati, actually. was kind of wondering if they would be collecting people with, uh, the western accents or something like that. don't know how many people are, uh, getting involved in this but … Uh-huh. … uh, well that's interesting. I'm, uh, uh, actually, uh, was kind of interested if you found out about the study by, uh, reading TELECOM DIGEST or was there another? Uh, a colleague of mine at, uh, work got some information over, uh, the computer network called INTERNET. Oh, okay. Yeah, that is how got it as well but, uh, And he just forwarded that on to me and, uh, it sounded like it would be an interesting project … Uh-huh. … to participate in so … Yeah, it will be interesting to see what, … sent back mail. It would be interesting to see how the data base, so, well, guess we're talking about the experiment. Uh-huh. Uh, probably need to try to get back on the topic but, uh, it's hard to talk about finances without without getting to, uh, dollar figures guess … Uh-huh. … you know, we could talk about some of the long range goals and, Well what other long range goals do you have besides college? Uh, well think, either my wife or would like to pursue advanced degrees at some point … Uh-huh. … uh, guess we will have to factor that in if we are not working for employers that happen to fund that. It seems like every year my employer just gives back, you know, a little bit your tuition reimbursement. Uh-huh."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0004_4327.utt,"Right, uh, actually lived over in Europe for a couple of years, lived in Germany and in Germany they don't have the jury system. What they do is they have, uh, three judges, basically. And you get up there and the prosecuting attorney presents his evidence and your defense attorney presents their evidence and those three guys take the evidence, go off, figure it out and then come back and say whether you're guilty or not. Ou-, ou-, our judicial system is in such total chaos. think what they need to do is, they need to somehow take the money out of it. I mean, when you have a man that's signed a, a, a statement saying he's guilty, we have a, a family called All day family. They were all murdered. Uh-huh. All the people signed confessions, they went to a trial by jury. They been trying these people now for twenty-two years, ever since was a child. Wow. And what they've done is they've bought Mercedes after Mercedes after Mercedes is what they've done, has nothing to do with justice whatsoever. Well, you know, it's, it's one of those things, I mean, uh, uh, would have to look at it. I-, if they did it with the, uh, just the judges, the police have to do a lot better job of making sure that their evidence is airtight because the judges sitting in that kind of stuff day after day, they know all the procedures, they know what's good and what isn't, they'd be able to say, I'm sorry, you can't use this as, uh, evidence, you know, because it was either illegally obtained or whatever and, you know, you wouldn't have this, uh, uh, theatrics where the lawyer jumps up and presents it to the, to the jury and then the judge says, oh, no, d-, disregard that. Come on, any jury's not going to disregard the evidence, you know . Uh, that's true. I, I, think our judicial system is attorney welfare myself. That may very well be. I, hold it in the utmost contempt. Uh, The, uh, d-, my favorite is the police department, they're not aimed at the criminal. The judicial system is aimed at the citizens because you and I, we have work schedules, we can be called at work, we have Social Security numbers, they can trace us down, we have telephones, then we have checkbooks. Criminals have none of these things. They're real difficult to catch, and if they do catch them, they don't get any monetary gain out of it, whereas us, we write a check. Yeah. So where do you think they target their efforts? That's true. You d-, They target their efforts toward the citizens … Well, … not the criminals. How would you go about changing it?"
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0004_4327.utt,"You know, that's a, I've nailed the problem down but I,. Leave the details up to somebody else, huh. Yeah, I'm going to have to leave those details like, what would you do about, think, to begin with, you would h-, you would have, like, here in Atlanta area, our crime rate is just astronomical, yet, you go out on the streets and they're giving speeding tickets. Yeah. think somehow you have to separate the revenues from, Well, you know, uh, talking about the lawyers, you know what might very well do, uh, cause a, uh, a drop in the number of lawyers and things like that, is to set the fees for cases. It's kind of like do it, do it in the similar vein similar, like, uh, C or television repair. If you take your V in, a lot of these V repair places will say, well, I'll repair your V for a hundred dollars, and if he gets in there and starts rooting around and finds something in there that's really tremendously wrong with it, then he eats it. He, he repairs it, gives it back to you, and takes your hundred dollars. Now, if he comes in and says, you know, I'll repair your, your C R, or somebody else's C R, for a hundred dollars, gets in there, maybe it's a blown fuse, takes him two minutes, he fixes it, he still charges you that hundred dollars. So, maybe if we did that with the lawyers, so that, you know, whether it's a murder case or a, you know, a civil, uh, somebody suing somebody else, you get dollars for that case and that's it. Now, None of this, firmly believe in that because when you get the most heinous of crimes, have you ever noticed you always get the most renowned defense attorney? Oh, yeah. And here's this bum that didn't have a job … Yeah. … and he's got a attorney that you and could never afford. That's true. Who's … Yeah. … paying for that? Um, y-, well, you, you know, you're talking to part of them that's paying for that . Yeah, and you're talking to the other half that's paying for it . That's right. You know that's, it, it's, it's amazing and, and when you stop and look at it, I mean, the judges, th-, they're all former lawyers. Yeah, well, that's another problem. think to really correct the judicial system, you have to get the lawyers out of it ."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0005_4646.utt,"Do you know anyone that, uh, is, is in a nursing home or has ever been in one? No. But I, my grandparents were looking into it before so know what they've said. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Well, I'm trying to think. My, uh, uh, wife's grandmother had Alzheimer's and they were going to put her into a, a nursing home and, uh, they, when they put her in, she had all kinds of trouble and the nursing home made them come and take her back because she was being a, a, you know, a, a nuisance. Or worse than a nuisance, I mean … Oh they thought it was too much of a bother. … she sort of went, you know, bananas and they couldn't, couldn't deal with her . So, guess you need to, uh, know whether it's a, you know, a no deposit, no return kind of thing whether , Right. If they're equipped too, to handle the kind of patients you're going to have … Yeah. … you know, put in there too. Because know my grandparents wanted to have some independence still. Right. They wanted some place they can go and have their meals and a nurse on staff just in case they needed her but they wanted to be independent as well. Right. Have their own room. My grandmother actually was in a, a nursing home that, uh, there was a retirement hotel and then a, uh, there was some sort of full-time care place that was also associated with it so for, uh, the first few years she had her own apartment and, you know, made her own meals sometimes. But could, could also go and eat someplace else. Uh-huh. And then, uh, as she became less able to take care of herself, then she moved into this other part that was able to, uh, provide full-time care and, uh, she didn't have to do anything anymore. But my experience has been that most people that move into nursing homes die very quickly. And that's som-, don't know whether that's because they, you know, sort of give up hope once they get in there or what the, the reason is. But think the average length of time that somebody lives in a nursing home is only like six months or something. Well a lot of it's probably to do with the fact that people go to it because they need help. Yeah. They need health care so they're already ill before they go. Right. That's probably a large factor. Yeah. If, if you can take care of yourself at all or have someone that can take care of you, then you stay where you are. Then you only go there as a last resort. Uh-huh. Or people send you there as a last resort. Right, right. That's what my grandparents, it was just so that the rest of the relatives would have peace of mind knowing that if anything happened, there was somebody there for them."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0005_4646.utt,"Uh-huh. So that was their thinking. Somebody who would know what to do in the event of an emergency. Right. And also so they could find someplace that they enjoyed while they still had choices to make. Right. So they wouldn't be stuck going into just whatever nursing home was available at the time. guess that's a problem too for people. Wait lists and all. Yeah, guess. That, uh, you can't always get in when you want too and of course, you can't just sit around and wait. Right. When you need it, you need it … Yeah. … guess. And the money is also another issue. How you're going to pay for it. Right. At that stage of life you only have so much money left and guess it's not exactly fair for the younger family members to have to put it in their savings. Yeah. I mean it is kind of fair, but it's also not fair because they have their own children to raise. Sure. So it's another problem. And you probably, if it were you, you probably wouldn't want someone choosing a place for you to live based on lowest price. Right, right. So, it, it's just so complicated anymore, think . People outlive their savings. And, with medicine being the way it is, you're extending life where sometimes the quality of living has gone down and they're not necessarily enjoying life anymore. Yeah. Well maybe that's the purpose of the nursing home is to have them go someplace where they can see that it's not worth continuing. It's just a shame that's the way it has to be. think … Yeah. … the retirement home idea's a nice idea. To go and find older people and with similar interests and someplace to stay and cause like if your spouse died, all alone, it'd be nice to go someplace with people similar to you. Right. To have friends. Yeah, I've known quite a few people that have, uh, gone to retirement communities."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0006_4108.utt,"Okay. Uh, so, what do you think, uh, about putting the elderly in a nursing home? Well, think that it, it varies on on the individual basis. Huh. Uh, sometimes it is, there is no alternative. Uh-huh . Uh, you do not have, uh, uh, family available or family that's, uh, you may not even have family that is, uh, uh, in, you know, who are around. That's true. Yeah. So, sometimes it's not an alternative. Huh . And think, uh, but think also, sometimes it can be, uh, a benefit if it's for a short time. Sometimes in a nursing home … Uh-huh. … uh, especially if, if it's after an acute illness. To get over a, or to rehab after, uh, an illness. That's true. never thought of that. Yeah. Sometimes you know, sometimes the nursing homes are good for, uh, just short periods of time. That's true, until they get over that hump … Uh-huh. … of whatever it is they're dealing with. Because too often the acute hospitals will, are sending them out much faster than what they're … Yes. … really able to. They really are. They don't like to keep them … So … longer than a week. … so there is some good to it. Yeah. Uh, sometimes too, it's used as a dumb job. You know the fam-, … What do you mean? … well the families do not necessarily , uh, know what to do with them and they don't want to take the responsibility so they will put them in a nursing home. Yeah, that's true. So you see, uh, there's both sides to it too. What do you think? Yeah and it depends on how, how sick the person is too. What you're capable of, like if you have a family to take care of, you know, of your own . Yeah. Yeah, uh, would personally like it if my parents were to get ill, would like to take care of them at home and if had the money with some help. That's not always possible. That's true. But, uh, to the best of my ability, I'd like to do it until it gets impossible . think that's also where you're going to have a lot of people who are going to, it's there's not a choice, it's … Right. … because, it's not economically feasible even to … Uh-huh . … put them in a nursing home. Yeah. So that, that option sometimes is not available if they do not have the, uh, either Medicare or insurance to cover it. That's true. Yeah. So, But think nursing homes can be good. It just depends on what kind they are. You know, you need to check them out ahead of time. Yeah, and then there's also some that are set up for specialties … Uh-huh. … uh, know some. Unfortunately, some elderly have to go to or have, guess it's Alzheimer's or where …"
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0006_4108.utt,"Uh-huh. … they wonder or, or, uh, confused or have some mental problem . Yeah, that they're , And you need a special nursing home for that. You need one that has a unit that's locked where they are not able to get out and roam around … Yeah. … and you need people who are trained for that type … Right. … of problem. Who know what they're doing with that. Yeah so, so there's different types of nursing homes think. Yeah well, my, uh, grandmother's not really in a nursing home, but a retirement home that also has a nursing home sort of attached to it. And she really liked the idea of, of moving there. She's not ill yet … Uh-huh. … but, uh, she worked there as a volunteer for about ten years and then she decided that, uh, she's eighty five years old, that eventually, you know, she she doesn't want her family taking care of her and being a burden. She's very independent. So she's in this nursing home. It's out in the country and, uh, she really enjoys it right now because she doesn't have to wash dishes or cook . Gives her a little bit of her own independence … Uh-huh. … but she still has, uh, a security there. Right. Some support. And then there's also, uh, sort of a wing for those people that do get sick and, what like about it and think she likes about it is that she knows everybody there now and then, so if she ever does become ill, uh, it will be like family around her. That's right and … Yeah. … I've seen some of them like that too and also they have a lot of, uh, activities going on for the ones … Uh-huh . … who are more active. Yeah. Sh-, So it's not sort of like, uh, uh … Uh-huh . … a sick place. No, she loves it. She has a great social life and she travels and, uh, it's in, in the very in the mountains and it's beautiful and, uh, I, hope that have something like that when get older . Yeah I, think, think the, uh … Uh-huh . … think that the decision that needs to be made though on nursing home has to be a joint one between the, uh, elderly … Uh-huh. … uh, person who's going in and the family that's going to be, uh, effec-, effected by it … Oh definitely it's, … and, uh, you know, sometimes it can, those choi-, those choices can be made in advance and sometimes … Right. …"

Well, it's about three hundred and fifty people. guess that's not large compared to some, but it's big enough. Uh-huh. And they have a, they don't have any kind of pension plan where they contribute anything and wish they did. Yeah. You know, they have a four one K, but put all the money into it. Uh-huh. They don't add anything. What about you? Uh, work for a fairly large company. It's got eight thousand people. Uh-huh. And, uh, we do have health insurance. We don't have four k-, one plan, stuff like that, but we do have, like, retirement. They kind of match up to, you, if you put six percent, they match up to six percent, and then the rest is whatever you want to put in. If you put more than that or something like that. Oh, that's a pretty good deal. It's not bad. Now, how long does it take for your contribution to vest? God, don't know. It's probably a long time . I'm sure it's not till like twenty-five years, thirty years. Yeah, the place work at's, health insurance is kind of expensive. It's like hundred bucks a, a month or something … Yeah. … for a family. Huh, well, guess what we have is like a f-, what they call a flex benefits plan where you, you get like a certain amount of dollars and then you spend it on a cafeteria of whatever you want or need. Otherwise you can, uh, guess you can put, also put money, hold money back and then either use or lose it and that doesn't get taxed or can just have that money, you know, put in your paycheck. Yeah, we have one of those use it or lose it plans, too, where, uh, they'll basically pay for, uh, you know, child care type, uh, expenses. can send in a, uh, can send in a request for payment and they'll, uh, and they'll send me, you know a check for the amount they withheld. That's pretty good, you know. It's, uh, it saves a third off on taxes or something. Yeah , well, it depends on which company you work for. know that, like, the, the, the one plan that everyone seems to be in, in my place is, uh, you know, you, uh, think you call it plan . Deductibles are really high, it's like fifteen hundred dollars, but if you go for the other ones you're paying too much money for them because it's unlikely, if you're f-, relatively, uh, healthy, then it's really unlikely that you'd use that much, amount of money, you know. So, the-, it, you know , someone did start a cost benefit analysis, and ends up the best is to take a high deductible and, and take a loss, what-, whatever it happens to be, if you happen to be a healthy individual ."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0007_4171.utt,"Yeah, guess, uh, on the other hand, you know, I, had a similar, had a similar health plan and, uh, one of my kids was in a car accident and, uh … Um. … had, wound up having to pay for, you know, a bunch of doctor visits and stuff out of my pocket because of, you know, no, no insurance policy happened to cover it, which is, Really? You mean, not even your, your, your car insurance? Well, it, it got all screwed up because had a high deductible on the health insurance, no fault here, and, and had a high deductible on the on the, uh, on the c-, car insurance and then s-, you know, we just goofed up the medical insurance and the car insurance and stuff and blew it . Oh, that's too bad. Oh, well. Yeah , uh, well, don't know, think other than health insurance, think, uh, you know, an extra week of, uh, time off would be nice. only get two weeks. Yeah, yeah my place you get two weeks when you start and then every, every year they give you an extra day until you've got four weeks. Oh, that's nice. We don't get them till, till your seventh year of service till … Aye. … you get an extra week. That's a long time. Yeah, it's, uh, Yeah, especially in the kind of engineering job I'm in, you know, companies don't stay afloat that long , and, and they, Uh, with the telecommunications type of company, supposedly you, used to be much more stable. It's a lot less stable than it used to be. They used to have job security crap , but now they don't. So you work for Bell or something like that? Yeah, it's the Bell Corps, which is, uh, Right. Yeah. Right. So, don't know, it's, it's, uh, no longer . So that's what, think it's still based on the old model of, and, and now they don't, uh, lifelong job security telephone … Yeah. … pioneers of America, all that stuff, huh. Yeah, but they, no, no longer . don't think so. Right. Uh, hearing a lo-, there's always, they're always laying people off, which is another benefit that you can have other than salary is trade that off for security. Is it, I mean, does it, they must have pretty good severance, though, huh? Oh, don't know, we don't, we haven't been doing layoffs. We've been doing, uh, down sizing with, uh, getting rid of extra layers of management. And, uh, don't know what they do for those people. Mean the, the, the management they get rid of? Some of it, yeah. Um."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0008_4321.utt,"Well, have you ever served on a jury? No, I've not. I've been called, but had to beg off from the duty. And you? Well, was called and then was not chosen. Um. Well, was, was, uh, originally chosen primarily, think, because was a young fellow and they tend to view the younger fellows as more likely to hand down a guilty verdict. don't know why. Something picked up in a psychology class some time ago. Oh, really? Yeah, it's that the younger they are, they tend to be more conservative for some statistical oddball reason, and they kind of liked me. looked conser-, and all that stuff and they, don't know what they saw in me, but they saw it. But, uh, back to the issue, is, uh, don't know, at times feel that a unanimous decision is warranted, especially in cases in which there's no smoking gun. But, there, too, there are also cases in which feel a majority rule might be acceptable, particularly, think in civil cases. In criminal cases, I'd like to see the unani-, unanimity remain, but in civil cases, think a majority rule by, by jury would be sufficient. Well, uh, could you give me an example of a case where you think that? Well, in a criminal case, say one in which, you know, there is, like, say assault or some such. think there ought to be a unanimous, uh, vote because by law and by constitution there must be proven beyond a shadow of a reasonable doubt that the person in question did this. And in civil law there, you know, is such a thing as like, let's say, uh, misappropriations or misuse of financial instruments or something like that. majority rule, think, would be more in line as there is no real smoking gun in the civil cases. don't know if I'm making any sense or not. Well, I mean, think, are you just trying to say that criminal cases are more, uh, tangible or, Yeah, often there's more incriminating evidence. Like, for instance, say, uh, and also, too, think I'm, I'm tempering this and the fact that the consequences are much more, uh, serious in a criminal case. Well, do you think that, that in a civil case, if there was majority rule, that it would be easy for someone to be set up? Um, well, really can't say for certain, truth be known. Uh, as it stands, there's, there's many ways and means by which a person can be set up, both, uh, in a civil , uh, civil and criminal case. I mean, the, uh, documentary, the THIN BLUE LINE pretty much demonstrated that. You know, don't know for, if you're familiar with that or not. No, I'm not. A, uh, fellow when he was much younger, uh, was tried and convicted and sentenced to death."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0008_4321.utt,"Fortunately, in his case, the death penalty was revoked and, uh, so he served out his, his sentence until it was discovered by a fellow who was making a documentary called the THIN BLUE LINE that this guy had basically gotten railroaded through the judicial system. The case was reopened and he was exonerated. Well, I mean, think that there are many cases in our judicial system where justice is not served. Yeah, many laws, but little justice. Say, but, uh, and also think, just like you were talking about before, why you were chosen to be on a jury that, uh, the, just, the process of picking jurors is not always objective. Oh, certainly not, certainly not. And , you know, they like to think that they're getting someone who's objective in all this, but they're really looking for someone who will pretty much fulfill the lawyers' desires. You know, the, because you get up and, and they ask you a few questions, both sides do, and then you, you're either challenged which is, you know, each attorney can use that as much as they like or, think it's a limit now, they probably have a limit now, but, they pretty much go through that, and then you have to give a reason to the court why you can't serve. For me, it was financial hardship, so. But, onto the thing, uh, was never aware that juries had any say on recommending sentencing. It was always my impression that the Justice himself, or herself, had the final say."

We live in the Saginaw area. Saginaw? Uh-huh. And I'm not real familiar with, uh, anything that, I, fact as far as know, the school doesn't have any kind of programs or anything out here. And, uh, or the grocery store or anything … Really? … in this area, yeah. The rec-, we live in Plano and they started off recycling by, uh, putting the, think at each Wal-Mart, they had some recycling dumpsters and things like that, which now, guess the, uh, city is, has bought the big green trash cans and, uh, we, they have a recycling truck that comes around now and you separate your glass and paper … Uh-huh. … and, uh, aluminum and you set it out and they pick it up and it, it works real neat. They seem to be having a real good response. Really? So, That is pretty good. I'm, we're originally from another state and know in the state we were from that they did that t-, similar type thing. The city brought ought, you know, set tr-, separate trash cans and you separated your stuff and you put it in there and they took it, you know. Did they, did they, like on bottles, did they give you a so many cents back for … don't really know. … for cans even or , don't really know, they, they started after we moved down here and so … Yeah. … I, I'm not really familiar. just know that, uh, my in-laws up in, up in Oklahoma, that's how they do, you know, they pick it up, but don't know if they get a, get anything back on it or, do you get money for it? No, just, noticed it Iowa and other cities like that, it's a nickel per aluminum can. Oh. So you don't see too many thrown out around the streets. Really . Or even bottles. You know, all kinds of bottles they, they, they really charge people to, guess when you purchase them and, and then when you turn them back in. Right. n-, remember the old days as a kid where bottle was a nickel. Right. And now, now most of them are throwaway. Right. So, maybe that's one thing they can do. think now they're a lot more expensive than that. Uh, bought some Cokes the other day in the br-, the little bottles … Uh-huh. … you know, and think the bottles were like, know they were at least ten cents apiece. started to see , at home, was like, God, how much were those bottles you know? Yes. And, it was, they come in like, uh, eight and, and eight and ten packs, you know … Right. … instead of six packs and, uh, and they were like, it was like two dollars and something for the bottles."

It's amazing. Well, out in this area, they really don't have anything. Now, know that like Minyard's … Uh-huh. … and places like that around like Arlington and Fort Worth and a lot of those grocery stores, they have like four different bins out front. Right. Uh, different colors for different things and, and things like that, but I, do know some of these places were doing that and they discontinued them because people were coming and dumping their trash in them. Right. Yeah it's, notice the plastic have sort of faded away, the milk jugs. Yeah. It, it's, people just, they, they really don't, uh, there's too much labor involved guess to separate the stuff. Yeah, more than it's worth. It's, don't know, it, it can be, it's not as easy ,. selecting, you know, clean junk as they say. Right. Well, who wants to clean their junk before they throw it away . That's right, that's right. It's like washing the dishes before you put them in the dishwasher. Right, uh, yeah. We all do it . Well, it was nice talking to you. It was nice talking to you. have no idea how long this is supposed to last or anything. Oh, think, think two or three minutes is … I-, … fine. Is that it? Yeah. Okay, well, it was nice talking to you and I, guess I'll do this for, was doing this for, actually, was going to do it for my son so that he could, uh, he, he's in high school, so that he could make some money.

I've heard some about Saturns. don't know a lot about them. haven't been over, uh, to a dealer to look at them although did see something in tonight's paper that said that their, uh reliability is rated to be equal to that of the, guess, the Japanese cars. comment on trans.? delete line? Ooh, that's great. Actually that's kind of the type of car that I, I'm thinking about we might get. Saturns, you can't go to a dealer unless you go to a, a Saturn dealer. Uh-huh. This, this offshoot of M . Yeah. And, uh, supposedly, they've got great customer satisfaction from what things I've heard. Um. Yeah, I've heard a lot of people like them. Uh, yet don't know wh-, whether would buy Saturn or not at this point. I'm kind of, my card and, uh, desires tend to be pretty picky and so, uh. Well, like what? Well, let's see. li-, like cars that are designed with, with human beings in mind,. and that's not just the driver and the passenger but that's the person who's working on it, cause do al-, almost all my own maintenance and, uh … Uh-huh . … those types of things. And found that while you can find some cars that are comfortable to ride in, uh, finding a ca-, car anymore that's, that's fairly easy for me to work on, it's just not very eas-, it's not very, almost unlikely at this point. Yeah. And, uh, yo-, Yeah. I've got a sixty-five Mustang and … Ooh. … I, and do the work on, most of the work on that myself. Uh-huh. And when look at modern cars and stuff like that, just say will never do that with the modern cars. It's not worth my time. You can't get in there. You can't do anything. Yeah. And it's so complicated too. look at it and say, boy, you know, I, I'd have to almost go take a class or something like that. Well I've got an eighty-three Saab. Uh-huh. And find that for a normal, you know, everyday things. It's really very easy to work on and so, uh, you know, I'm kind of spoiled. used to have a Chevy. Uh-huh. With a three fifty in it. Yeah. And, uh, really liked working on it. Uh, cause it was pretty easy too. It was about a nineteen seventy. So I'm kind of, uh, biased in that and, you know, want a car that can work on because think it just costs too much even to get the oil changed anymore. Yeah . And that's kind of, that's, that's probably one thing I'd look at. think another thing I'd look at is safety. Yeah. That's one of the things that my wife and have thought about. Actually, the car, one of the cars we'd most like to get would be the new ninety-one Ford Taurus cause they're actually one of the cheaper cars that have dual …"
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0010_4356.utt,"Huh. … side air bags. That's a real nice car, think. Yeah . I've driven some, uh, Tauruses over the last couple of years when I've been on business trips. Uh-huh . Uh, as rental cars. And I've always been very impressed with the Taurus. It's a really nice car. think it's very , it's a stylish car both inside and out. It's comfortable to drive. Uh, reasonable performance, and this is out in California where, where they don't make a car that's got reasonable performance anymore. Yeah. Uh, I've been real impressed with that. Yo-, and didn't realize that they were putting dual, uh, air bags in that car now. Ninety, yeah. Or, excuse me, the ninety-twos. The … Uh-huh. … ninety-twos had dual air bags. This newest model. You could … Oh, think that , … get them with duals . That's excellent. That's excellent because, Yeah. But the thing is that it's twenty thousand dollars. Actually, my, my wife and are actually thinking, contemplating buying a new car in the next year and a half or so. So we're actually … Oh. … been looking around and thinking about things. We'd like to get like a - oh, don't know. What do you call it? dealer return type thing on a ninety-two and ninety-three or something like that you know. Uh-huh. Year old ninety-two or something like that. Uh-huh. Sure. Those are … See if we, … yeah, that, that would be a good deal to go with. And the other thing we're looking at is the Saturns too. Okay. Because they looked really nice. Uh-huh. What do you, what do you looking for in, in those? What, what attracts you to the Saturns? Or, or, of course, we've already talked, you know, the Taurus is safe. But wh-, what kind of things are you looking for? Well, the Saturns you can get air bags in them. don't think you can get dual side air bags. Uh-huh. But one of the, the two things that I'm really, the, the I'd say the most important thing is a car that's not going to fall apart. That doesn't have problems. Uh-huh. You set down. You look at consumer reports. We've been pouring over consumer reports and you just get so depressed for the S auto … Yeah. … makers when you do that. Because you see the reliability and the types of problems they have and, and the two cars that apparently are close to that. That actually have high reliability, the Taurus is one of the highest S cars. Uh-huh. And the other one is, are the Saturns. Uh-huh. So those two things. And then, you know, we kind of want a four door. Okay ."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0011_4358.utt,"Okay. What is your, uh, community, uh, currently doing with regard to recycling? Uh, basically, they're just, uh, having various recycling, uh, bins, uh, located for, uh, trash pickup. Uh-huh . Well that's more than we have up here in Massachusetts. Some, some local communities are very active in that, uh, in that respect and they do have bins set up. But live in a, a metropolitan area and, uh, they're not, uh, too inclined to do something as aggressive as that . Well, here they and, uh, live in an apartment complex. Uh-huh. And they only have one set of recycling bins, one or two sets as opposed to a set at each of the dumpsters. So a lot of the people who live up front don't bother to recycle because, you know, it's too far to carry the stuff to the other bins. I, know a lot, think a lot of, uh, the, the issues with regard to recycling are that, uh, people have to be motivated to do, to do something like that because it does take extra effort. Whether - and, and think that, and know Massachusetts has, a bottle bill was passed and we have had a bottle bill for quite a few years now, and the majority of the incentive in recycling bottles probably, believe it or not, is just to get the extra nickel at the, uh, the store and not, uh, that's the majority of people that know of anyways. Where people aren't really, you know, eco conscious. It's just the fact that it's something they have to do. And I'm not going to throw a bottle away, it's like throwing a nickel away. That type of thing. Right. They, But, uh, people need to be more conscious of it. Th-, here they're trying to push through a bill and a lot of people are against it. And it's going to create a lot more work for the, uh, the stores that sell, you know, sodas and stuff. Because they want to implement a refund on cans and on plastic bottles and everything. Yeah . It didn't, it, it took awhile for that bill to be passed up here as far as recycling bottles and cans. Uh, and, and matter of fact, think it took like three tries t-, for it to go through. But, and it's been pretty successful and people notice it as far as, uh, highways being, uh, you know, people would dr-, have a drink of soda, instead of throwing out the window, they, they keep the bottle so it's, it's been a ecologically sound policy and, you know, as, as far as recycling your bottles in terms of trash and so forth. But more importantly, it's recycling reusable materials back into, uh, manufacturing. And that's the big thing, think, that th-, they try to promote."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0011_4358.utt,"Right. think here if they, uh, instead of just, you know, requiring that you put, put out the trash and stuff, if they could get some kind of rebate, those people who do put the stuff out, uh, you know, and separate it, have lower collection fee or something may … Yeah, that's a good idea. … encourage … Yeah. … people to separate. Th-, there definitely has to be a motivation factor and know that, at w-, where work, work for a defense contractor. And there's a big push on for recycling, uh, paper materials, you know, computer output paper and also to decrease the amount of, uh, Styrofoam usage because of the, uh, the process involved in Styrofoam and, and the whole eco issue and that. And, and they're very proactive and, uh, matter of fact, they give you discounts if you use, uh, china wear rather than, uh, Styrofoam stuff, so. So, i-, i-, it's incentives like that that get people people more conscious of it. think that's, that's what they need to do. Be more proactive like that. Uh, know, uh, believe it was last year that they actually collected the old phone books. Uh, usually have them come from you know, projects to collect old ones. Usually just get dumped out with the trash. And phone books are a large volume of annual trash. Yeah. They, they just, matter of fact, that, that reminded me of an article saw in the pa-, the local schools, you could send your phone book to your, uh, to, with your kid to school and what they'll do is they'll recycle it. Because there was an article or a story done awhile ago that, uh, trash, uh, the telephone books are the type of thing that don't break down over a long period of time. guy went to a d-, a landfill, dug down five feet and, and pulled up a phone book from like nineteen sixty because they don't, they don't degrade over such a period of time. Well, part of the problem with recycling them in the past has been the covers are made with a clay based paper. Yeah. They contain the glue and stuff and they used to have to take out all the, uh, pages and then cut the spine off to be able to recycle them. Yeah. Now think they've come up with some way of, uh, pulling the glue out. Yeah. Okay ."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0012_4360.utt,"Uh, let's see. How about, uh, let's see, about ten years ago, uh, what do you think was different ten years ago from now? Well, would say as, far as social changes go, uh, think families were more together. They, they did more things together. Uh-huh . Uh, they ate dinner at the table together. Uh, the parents usually took out time, uh, you know, more time than they do now to come with the children and just spend the day doing a family activity. Uh-huh. Uh, although I'm not a mother, I, still think that, uh, a lot has changed since ten years ago. Uh, what do you … We, … think about that? Well, uh, actually ten years from today seems rather short. Yeah. Uh, but do agree that, uh, generally it's, society has sort of, uh, let's see, rushed everything ahead. Uh-huh. And, uh, don't know, it leaves, leaves a lot of time out for family and things like that. In other words, they just prioritize their lives differently. But think that has a lot to do with economic situation. Yes. What about like as far as, uh, social changes in the individual? Do … Uh, … you think that the individual has as much time as they did, let's say, ten, twenty years ago? Um. It depends. Uh, it's hard to say because think people were busy ten twenty years ago too. Uh-huh. Uh, just , Well, how, how old are you? I'm twenty-eight. Twenty-eight. Okay, I'm twenty-three. Yeah. So there's maybe a five year gap between us. Yeah. So, uh. just, think that things were a bit, were, have been busy all along. It's just … Huh . … a matter where priorities are, at placed. Yes. And that, uh, usually as far as families are concerned, there used to be just one person working and usually the other parent was home. Uh-huh. And now, uh, it's pretty much an economic necessity of, for most, in most places for both parents to work. Do you think it's an economic c-, necessity or do you think that we're, we're, uh, all trying to keep up with a certain standard of living? think that's part of it too. But do think, I mean do you think,. people really need two cars and … No, no. don't. … a house in the suburbs or, No, don't think that. But then there are a lot of people that, that don't have that. Uh-huh. But, that really do need to work. Uh-huh. think maybe those people that really do need to work, both parents, just to survive. And … Yeah. … then there, th-, is, is that other group that is … Uh-huh. … working to maintain a standard of living … Okay. … that, uh, they think is, is surviving which is really more luxuries.

/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0012_4360.utt,"Uh, but tend to think that it's less those people that have the two cars and everything than it is the group that is just trying to survive. Yo-, so you think it's, which group are you saying is the one trying? I'm saying that the, uh, the group that is just trying to survive from day to day, where both parents are working … Uh-huh. … is more of the majority than the, than the people that have the higher standard of living. Because if you look at economics across this country and statistics on who has the money and who the decreasing, uh, middle class in this country … Uh-huh. … think that that's, in my opinion, the case. Okay. So. I mean have met people that, uh, both that, that just want to maintain a, the standard of living and those that, that really need the job. Okay. And then, sometimes I, often, uh, find that maybe there's so many different things available to us. Yo-, a microwave, a C R, a answering machine … Uh-huh. … a, you know, a special, a dishwasher, uh, a refrigerator and some of those items, um, for the, for the, uh, well guess we're sticking more to social changes but, uh … Uh-huh. … people want all of that and not all of those are necessities.

And seems to me that that's, think that's the way it's done now. Uh, at least,. my understanding of the law which isn't very good. Uh-huh. Uh, it seems to me that the judge does it and I, think that's probably all right in that they, you know, maybe know what the, the norm is … Uh-huh. … for a particular thing. And, guess, also what the system will absorb . Right. Probably more tuned in to that. Possibly though on, uh, capital cases like maybe the death penalty … Uh-huh. … uh, I'm kind of undecided on that whether the judge should have the sole, I mean he could have like a personal prejudice. You know, judges are people like everybody else … That's right. … even though they're, they're supposed to be impartial but maybe, uh, And think that may, I, that may be an exception as well.

Uh, guess,. kind of the way think about it also, is they just, if somebody gets the death penalty, they're, they're judged guilty, they got the death penalty, they should have one year and one appeal."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0013_4617.utt,"Cover all their bases with one appeal and if not, you know, don't, don't let them sit up there on death row for, you know, fifteen years. Yeah. think this particular case has been like ten or fifteen years. Uh-huh. Yeah, that, But guess there have been several cases where people have been executed by mistake and … Yeah. Oh, I'm sure . … you'd hate to be one of those. Yeah. The other thing they asked about was whether uh, uh, the verdict should be required to be unanimous. Uh-huh. Which, again, think is the way it is now. That all the, all verdicts, well maybe not. don't know. At least in capital cases I'd think they'd have to be … believe it is … unanimous. … in capital. think in like, uh, lesser cases it's like ten out of twelve or five out of six, whatever . Uh-huh. How ever many is on, sitting on a jury. t-, believe that's the way it is. But I'm pretty sure you're correct on capital cases. Uh , Yeah. The paper here tonight had a thing about the Noriega trial. Uh-huh. And that there's one juror that is, is, uh, different than the other eleven. Yeah. And, uh, they've only deliberated four hours or,. something and they say they're hopelessly deadlocked. Oh, no . And the judge told them ,. they weren't hopelessly deadlocked yet . I'm telling you, go one way or the other. That, that's probably an expensive trial. Uh , Yeah. Six months so far they said. Yeah. Probably. So. Yeah. Probably. You know, I'm not sure there's a number. It's probably like thirty, forty thousand dollars a day you know, worth of all the free for all. Maybe they could go with a, with a nine hundred number and have people dial in and give their, uh, vote. Yeah . Yeah, that's, that's been so long I've prac-, practically forgot who Noriega was, you know. Right. That has been going on . My, uh, cousin is a B agent down in Miami. Oh really? Yeah. So she follows that stuff pretty closely. But, uh, That's interesting. Yeah, she's not involved in that, that case. But she does, Well have you ever served on a jury? No haven't. never have. My wife has but I, haven't. Uh-huh. got called but I, uh, never, uh, got selected for a jury , Uh-huh. sat for tw-, ten days … Uh-huh. … in a court room while they went through the selection process,. and they had some guy that was, uh, defending himself. Uh-huh."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0014_4619.utt,"Bye . So we're, uh, our discussion's about, uh, the care of the elderly? That's right, that's right. You know, what, what, uh, what do you think is important? If you were, uh, don't know how, how old you are, but if you had, if you had, uh, parents say or, or, or th-, grandparents, whatever it is, uh, who were ready,. who, who you thought might benefit from a nursing home, what do you think you would look for? Uh, well I, actually my dad's, my dad's almost ninety and … Huh. … he lives by himself and he's in good shape. Yeah. Uh, but, uh, some friends of mine have, uh, gone through this. think I'd look for a home where they got a lot of attention and, uh, where they did some things to try to keep them, um, mentally alive. Yeah. And where there was, uh, caring and compassionate, where there were caring and compassionate people, uh, operating it. Do … Huh. … you have any experience with this yourself? Well my, uh, uh, my wife's grandmother … Uh-huh. … is in a nursing home in, uh, Minnesota and we go there, uh, once a year. We see, we tend to see her there cause we're in Boston so we're pretty far away. When we visit Minnesota though we go to see her. Uh-huh. And it seems, uh, I mean the, the environment there, don't know too much about it but it, it seems nice enough. Uh, it, it's hard, at least half of the residents would say are not, not mentally sound. So it's hard to tell how much of that rubs off on those who are struggling to r-, to retain, uh, clarity, say, uh, you know . From the lack of stimulation, you mean. Yeah. Well I, don-, don't know. We, we also, my wife and I, uh, uh, volunteer to go to a, uh, nursing home that's just a mile from our house. We, uh, she goes more often than I. We used to go once a month, once every two months to visit some of the patients there. And we'd take, we have a two year old son and so we, sometimes we'd take him with us. And, uh, there would say it's the same thing. It's, it's a nice, uh, relatively nice environment but again, um, it must be depressing for the people who, who are, who are just e-, e-, essentially not able to take care of themselves in their own house but, but, certainly, uh, certainly have ar-, ar-, are, have retained all of their, uh, mental skills and so on. It's, must be depressing to, to walk, walk the halls and see, an-, and see all these other people who really don't know where they are. Do you think that in the case of the one that you've actually had some experience with, that the people who operate it seem to have, what you'd perceive of as genuine concern?"
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0014_4619.utt,"think, yeah, think they're relatively re-, respectful. Yeah and, and concerned that, in as much as they can be. I, think sometimes, you know, I've noticed, uh, people asking for, uh, some of the patients asking for things, uh, just repetitively … Uh-huh. … and, but things that are not reasonable, and so … Yeah. … at some level the, the, the, uh, I'm sure that the, that the, uh, the staff l-, learn what's normal for this person and so it looks to me like maybe their not catering to this person's needs is really because this person is just, you know, is just in a state where they don't really need what they think they need, you know. Yeah. It, it's possible, was thinking also that there'd be, there could be a fair burn out factor … Oh, yeah. … um, in just having to respond to people's needs where the needs are sometimes, depending on the person, not going to be what we would perceive of as rational need. Yeah. I'll tell you one thing though that'll, that, that I, saw that was really nice. We saw a husband and wife, we used to see a husband and wife in there, uh, together and they were in the same room which not all husband and wives were but these two were. Uh-huh. And when you walked into their room, they had brought all their furniture from their house … Uh-huh. So it … And so, … gives them a sense of identity. Yeah, you walked in there and it didn't look like, uh, you know, how, yo-, you, you walk into some rooms and there's, it's completely generic. There's nothing, maybe a picture or two that belongs to that person and that's it. But this room, on the other hand, you know, they got rid of all of the sort of standard issue beds and dressers and this and that and they had all their stuff from their house and it looked like, uh, i-, i-, it must have been, it was nicer to walk in there and to talk to them and it must also give them a sense of, uh, uh, security and, and, uh, and, and, you know, s-, s-, uh, Yeah, I, think part of what you're saying matches what h-, have read. used to initially think that the only people who went into such residences were people who, uh, were adequately deficient in their abilities, uh … Yeah. … physical or mental, that they couldn't take care of themselves. But also know a couple of people whose parents have gone into such things because think they provide, um, a lot of social activities. Huh. Yeah. Uh, the, one of my friend's parents who went in because she had largely lost her abilities - and she was in there for awhile when they were away on vacation."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0014_4619.utt,"Uh, and, Huh. temporary. I, that, that's, that's new to me. I, Well think it, think t-, it was sort of on the grounds that they were considering whether she would live there and feel like, the whole vocabulary of this is very loaded if you think of words like, like put her in there. Right, right."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0015_4877.utt,"Okay. Uh, so your, you, guess you're probably in the same, uh, same situation uh, we're in. We're kind of past having to provide child care. Our, our kids are grown up. We don't have any grandchildren yet. But, uh, uh, they're, Uh-huh. How old are your children? Uh, one's twenty-six and the other is, uh, twenty, twenty-one. Uh-huh . So they're, uh, uh, Well, they're going to be getting there. They're, they're getting there. You know, there's no … Yeah. … no, no prospects right away for anything to happen. U-, uh-huh. Oh, see. But, uh, have, uh, five children. have a eighteen year old son. The rest of my girls are like twenty-three, twenty-six, twenty-eight, and twenty-nine. Uh-huh. And have three granddaughters right now. Oh. And, uh, I, uh, one's in Iowa. Uh-huh. And, uh, she's, she's a teacher and what she does is she,. teaches at a preschool. Oh, okay. And, and so she kind of, and they let her bring her, her little daughter in for free. Uh-huh. And then, so - but she just works part-time. Uh-huh. Then have another daughter in, uh, Bountiful, Utah and she has to work full-time and it's just tearing her apart. She has a private baby-sitter. Yeah. And, uh, the baby just screams. I mean, the baby is like seventeen months and she just screams. Uh-huh. Well even if she knows that they're fixing to get ready to go over there. They're not even there yet … Uh-huh. … you know. Yeah. It's hard. We, And, and then have my, uh, uh, have a seven month old granddaughter and, uh, her mother stays home and she, they live, they live with us. You know, in, as Orange County … Uh-huh. … is really expensive. Uh-huh. They live with us and so, of course, we love it. Because we get to see this cute little baby all the time. But, uh, uh, she just, uh, she used to work in pre, in the preschool and, and, and child care and she says after working in there - and, and, you know, here she was a provider but, you know, there's only so much one person can do. Yeah. She said it's so awful. She said she'll never put her child in a, in a, in a preca-, in a p-, in a preschool. Uh-huh. I'm sure there must be some good ones around here somewhere. Huh. But it's really, it's really, really very difficult and, Yeah. What did you do when your kids were growing up? Were you, Well, when, when - the, uh, the first, uh, ten years, see first ten or twelve years, stayed home. Uh-huh. And, uh, then after that I, went to work. Uh-huh. And, uh, uh, uh, a couple of times just, uh, uh, you know, th-, then had one job and then that job ran out because it was kind of a government seeded type job."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0015_4877.utt,"And then, and then like about, later I, tried to get the baby to a baby-sitter. Supposed to be good, uh, recommended person from the church - and knew her personally. She had two kids of her own and everything. But quit my job because couldn't stand how she was taking care of my child. Uh-huh. I mean, first of all, uh, her children were sick all the time. So when my son stayed over there, he got sick. He got sick, yeah. Same thing, same thing that the, her kids had, right? Right. Well, And so, uh, we didn't take her over there until like about eleven o'clock. Then he, she'd take my son and her daughter over t-, to kindergarten. But s-, that day, uh, was saying now he, he's sick. And she goes well, she goes, he has the same thing that all my kids have. That's what he got, you know. Goes, well, okay, so it's not like he's going to infect her kids. But then what happened was, is, said, uh, he just threw up and kindergarten starts at eleven thirty so she said well she'll keep him home and he'll probably just sleep anyway. Well, you know, what that woman sent her, sent him to kindergarten. She sent him to kindergarten. As soon as he went there, the teacher took one look at him and he threw up again and they put him in the nursery, uh, they put him in the nurse's office. Guess so , yeah. And then what happened was, is, you know, they gave her a call because they knew that she was my baby-sitter. Called her - and they said, uh, that he's sick. Well she wasn't home. Huh. I mean her, all her kids were sick but she wasn't home, right. And her, and her, her daughter that was in kindergarten with him also did not go to school because she was sick. Now why didn't he, why didn't she keep him home with her? No, she didn't do that. So, it got to the point where he's, he's supposed to get out of, uh, kindergarten like about two thirty. And had to leave work. It was, it was five o'clock in the evening and found out he was still there at school. And they were calling me and they said somebody's got to pick him up. And kept thinking that she was going to get picked up, she was going to pick him up because she only lives in like two blocks away from the school. was trying to get my husband to come and pick him up and all that kind of stuff. And he had a hundred and four fever. They couldn't, uh, give him anything because they're not allowed to at school and everything. Right. was so furious. I, quit that job and stayed home for awhile longer. Then went and got a, uh, a job in real estate where can kind of adjust my time a little bit better."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0015_4877.utt,"Yeah, a little more flexibility. You can come and go. Yeah, but, uh, haven't had any good, really very good experience with child care . Yeah. When, when our kids were small we had a couple of, uh, good, good women who, uh, would often c-, uh, get them to come to the house."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0016_3389.utt,"So, who's your favorite team? My favorite team is the Pittsburgh Steelers. Pittsburgh? You bet. used to be a big Pittsburgh fan when was little. Well, I, uh, when John Stallworth played he was from my hometown in Alabama, Oh, really? so kind of grabbed on to that team, Huh. That's pretty nice . way back when. Yeah, that's good. I, used to watch them a lot when they were playing the big iron curtain, That's right. or steel curtain. How about your favorite team? Huh. Well, last year it was Buffalo and I, still try to keep up with Buffalo because they just, they just impressed me as being so efficient and they never score. They never blow out their opponents. They just score just enough points, Uh-huh. and that really impressed me. But then down here li-, is pretty close to New Orleans and I've been keeping up with the Saints a lot. Well, they are exciting, aren't they? Yeah, the Saints are starting to impress me this year, you know, a lot. Boy, they are, they are just a fun team to watch. This, it, they are really. Did you see the game Sunday night or, Uh, Sunday afternoon? no, didn't. It was funny. There were, they ha-, uh, a fireworks display at halftime. Oh, yeah? Yeah, and some paper or something in the Super Dome up in the roof caught on fire. Oh, you're kidding . So, they had to stop the game in lieu of the third quarter … Oh, my gos-, … and put out this fire. Those big piece of something came flaming, falling out of the roof and landed on the field so there's this big fire on the field and they were dumping the Gatorade bucket and everything. Oh, can't believe that. It was funn-, I mean, you just really can't tell what's going to happen. That's hilarious. know. It's like about two weeks ago was watching the Saints. Uh-huh. And Morton Anderson kicked a sixty yard field goal. Oh. And it, it was beautiful, right down the middle. Oh, boy. He is tough, he has … He is. … an incredible leg. Yes. Well, do you think they're, they're going to be able to make it this year, Uh s-, past the first playoff game? sure hope so. I'm not sure, I'm not sure who they play. Right now I've got it narrowed down to the top four teams. Who's that? It's pretty much going between Washington. They are undefeated. Right. And, uh, Buffalo, New Orleans, and Chicago because Chicago has only lost twice and one of those was to Buffalo. And they beat the Saints. Their only time they lost. What do you think about, uh, Houston? Houston. saw Houston play this summer in Memphis. Oh, yeah? Yeah."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0016_3389.utt,"Uh, from what saw they were playing, when was at the game we sat right on the front row, Huh. right behind the Houston Oilers, and from what saw the game Houston, Houston impressed me a lot. Huh. But my brother watched it on V and said that Warren Moon was just having an off night, and if that was an off night I'd hate to see when he's on a good night. Oh, yeah, he's … He's, … he definitely, uh, is one of the best think. Yeah, the, their, their backfield is really impressive. Haywood Jeffreys and Drew Hill … Right. … and Allen , they really impress me. Well, they squeaked out a game on Sunday. That's right. Who, who did they play? They played Dallas. Dallas, that's right, They won, all because, in overtime. That's right. remember that now. So that was, I, watched that game and, uh, that was, uh, Do you have a favorite between those two? Well, because I'm right here in Dallas I, kind of pull for Dallas. Really?. Yeah. Well, also Houston is, uh, in Pittsburgh's division so, Well, that's true. I'll almost always root against them. hate to say it but hate Dallas . That's okay . Well I, you know, I, was never really a big Dallas fan … Yeah. … until we moved here and they just kind of grew on me. Yeah, imagine. That's the way, I've never been a big Saints fan until the last year or two and they, they've actually started doing something. Yeah. Yeah. So, I've actually pl-, paid attention to them. Well , Well, do you know anything about the expansion teams they're thinking about bringing in? To tell you the truth haven't paid too much attention to that. Really? Um, what cities are they looking at? Uh, right now think this Memphis, they're, they're trying to get the teams. Uh-huh. And that's, that's where was when saw, uh, Uh-huh. Houston play. Saint Louis is trying to get a team. Uh, Baltimore is trying to get a team, and there's some other city. I'm wanting to say Raleigh Durham but I'm not sure. You know, think you are right. think it is Raleigh. Think so? think remember hearing that. Uh-huh. Because know they've got a football team but think it might be them. That would be fun. I'd like to see some more teams get in. would, definitely. think they are supposed to put two in by either next year or the year after. And right now think Memphis and, it's Memphis and think Baltimore have a really good shot at it. Uh-huh. Because know Saint Louis is much bigger than Memphis and when went up there they were saying that Memphis sold more tickets than Saint Louis did. Oh, really?"
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0016_3389.utt,Yeah.
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0017_4036.utt,"Definitely. Um, and think that, you know, a unanimous verdict, uh, helps to ensure that. guess maybe one drawback of it is that if you have one juror who is very unreasonable in some way, that, uh, you, uh, would have a problem, uh, you know, that you wouldn't convict someone who maybe should be convicted. Uh-huh. Have you ever served on a jury before? Uh, have twice. Oh, okay. It was a pretty wild experience. Uh, what sorts of cases were they? They were just, you know, small time cases where, uh, trailers and banks were involved, you know. So were they criminal or civil? They were civil. They weren't … Oh, okay. … they weren't any criminal. What, uh, what was the verdict? Did the, did the jury have trouble reaching a decision? Uh, the jury, it was, uh, let me see, think it was ten to one on the jury, because they only had to have eleven people … Yeah. … so it was, they, and, uh, the one changed his vote at the end. So did it become? So it became unanimous, you know, after they turned it in … Yeah. … and then he changed his mind after they turned it in … Uh. … but it then became unanimous. Uh. But since it was a civil case it really didn't matter, right? You just needed a majority? Right. What was, what was the other case? That was also civil? The, the other case was just traffic, the, and, you know, it was seat belt law … Yeah. … and it, it didn't even hardly … Oh, didn't really even count. … go through, so. Yeah. I'm, I'm a college student so haven't been, you know, a jury eligible age for very long … Yeah. … um, and, uh, did get one summons actually at one point, but declined it which I'm able to do because I'm a student, because it was, uh, a very bad time. Yeah. Well, you learn a lot going to the juries like that though. Yeah, I mean, I, really, would like to, uh, to do at some point, um, but, I, haven't. Uh, one, one thing that I, think is, um, you know, maybe is a problem is, uh, I, think that the criminal jury system works pretty well now, but wonder if maybe in some civil cases it doesn't work as well. Especially sort of. wouldn't think that it does … How, wha-, … I mean, from, from my, from what experienced in them, it didn't, you know, it didn't turn out the way planned it, I mean, the way that would think that it would go. Uh, you thought it turned out pretty well? Yeah, but it was, you know, it was, jury was unorganized and it was, it was just wasn't organized enough for me. Yeah. I'm not used to it not being organized, and just assumed that it would have been."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0017_4036.utt,"Oh, so it was just kind of a zoo and the jurors just sort of, someone had to figure out what was going on? That's about what it was. Um. That's interesting. Did it, did it work out pretty well in the end? I mean, did a couple of people sort of gradually, sort of assume, uh, sort of a moderator role in the trial or, Yeah, they, well they picked one person, and then he finally, you know, moderated everything and made it turn out the way it should have. So it work-, it did end up working out pretty well? Yeah, it ended up working all right. The one thing sometimes wonder about, um, in civil cases is, uh, whether, especially sort of in, uh, maybe like pro-, product liability, or medical malpractice, where there's, um, sort of a very technical decision to be made sometimes … Yes. … you know, it's not just a matter of, um, of, you know, did this guy rip off this guy, and it's just a matter of interpreting a contract, it's sort of a matter of, um, you know, sometimes getting into very technical issues, and wonder if, uh, if there's really, um, if the system works adequately in, in educating the jurors about, uh, whatever, um, you know, issue is under discussion. I, don't think that they, they, they educate them enough to, to really know what's going on. In, in the case you were involved in, you said it was just sort of a bank matter of some kind. So. Yeah, the, the bank was suing them for, uh, because they went to get the, the trailer … Yeah. … that, which was, uh, seemingly their property. Uh. It was on his property. Oh, so the deal was that he had, uh, borrowed money from the bank to buy it, and … Right. … he hadn't made the payments. So they came to get it. Yeah. And then when they came to get it, well, it was on the landlord's property and he wouldn't let them take it off. Uh, so they were suing to get it back. So, and they are, it was a double wide, so they'd already taken it apart. Uh. So they left it there … Yeah. … and then when they came back to get it a couple of days later it had rained and got all in it. Uh."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0018_4082.utt,"Uh, get most of my news uh, from newspapers really. read the daily newspaper, uh, the HOUSTON CHRONICLE and sometimes I'll read like the, uh, WALL STREET or the NEW YORK TIMES. don't subscribe to either, but sometimes get a hold of copies of it. Uh, how about you? Do you, uh, mostly … Yes. … get things from V or . actually get most of my news coverage off uh, computer networks. However, do also watch television news, uh, usually in the morning once a day and read the front page of the WALL STREET JOURNAL … Oh. … most every day. Oh that's interesting. You said computer networks. Uh, what, uh, what sort. am fairly knowledgeable of . Uh well, well DOW JONES for example have the, cause the … Uh, okay. That's interesting. … uh, news wire - and it's picked up and actually available, uh, at my office, so, it's, no fee, or subscription either to read at my leisure and it's sort of by category. For example … Oh. I-, … so can read a certain business or topics. … is it,. is it the P news wire or is it something that is, uh, a little bit different from that? Well, uh, it's similar to that, but it's DOW JONES, which is, uh, the WALL STREET JOURNALS news wire. Uh, okay. So, that's that's interesting. Okay. Yeah, I've had, had access in the past to, uh, uh, the P news wire and thought that was that was pretty a pretty good way to get news. Uh, I've never used the DOW JONES news wire but, uh, yeah it, uh, do you get any, uh, do you read any news magazines or anything like that for sort of like a broader, like more long term analytical sort of approach? Uh, well actually not. Uh, do, uh, follow, uh, uh, uh, don't know how to how to describe it so I'll say a religious newspaper which, which talks about issues that are relevant to me in a more broad sense. It's a weekly … Yeah . … but, uh, but not, uh, not like BUSINESS WEEK or NEWS WEEK or one of those kinds of things. I'd like to say that however, uh, that I'm overwhelmingly disappointed with the media in general except for the raw news wires . In what way? In like, in sort of like, uh, qual-, uh, quality or sort of an orientation in terms of like, view point or the way the news is presented or whatever? Uh, think that it, think that it has to do with, uh, personally think, uh, I, have a problem with their viewpoint and personally think that, uh, ther-, … Yeah. Well you won't offend me.

People who are journalist who are trained to write and they're, that's a liberal, uh, a liberal field … Yeah. … at least from academia and, uh, the other thing that always notice is that whenever they write about something that I'm an expert in, find their descriptions to be wrong … Yeah. Yeah. … and it, They, they generally make mistake on anything technical at least . That's right. Well, even if it's not technical. If it's, uh, some social thing or whatever. It doesn't matter. If am an expert in it, they usually make mistakes which makes me believe think I'm not expert in it. They're telling me lies. Yeah. Yeah. Do you, by mistakes, do you mean just like honest mistakes or do you think they are deliberate sorts of things? Uh, think both. Uh, by deliberate I, uh, mean mistake, mistakes of omission or, uh, or, uh, biased toward a particular view point … Yeah. Yeah. … a particular liberal … Yeah. … view point that they have. Yeah. So, uh, uh, to give you an example, uh, we will go out of the printing media. know of cases where, uh, we have one television media where they will show clippings from one event and describe another event but, with the the attempt to give you the impression that what they're talking about is the same thing they are showing you. Huh. Which is sort of like a deliberate bias. Huh. That's disturbing. Which is which is rather disturbing. I mean he does that. haven't really noticed them doing that, but whatever, again don't watch V news that much now. If had access to N N, would watch V news more. Uh, don't you know, but don't usually. Yeah, don't have access either. Although, did at one time and it was, did during the Gulf War and it was addictive. Yeah. Did you, did you think that N N, well, the Gulf War coverage would be kind of, uh, an abnormality? just wonde-, guess. would be curious to know what you thought as to how like say N T news compared to the three networks. Uh, you know whether you thought it was more of a biased or whatever but I, guess you wouldn't. You probably, if you just watched it during the Gulf War, that probably wouldn't wouldn't tell you much. Yeah, well during that small sample, would think that everyone was just about, just about the same, except the three networks, radio television programming. Yeah.

Uh, right now I'm just, uh, I, don't really have a budget per se. I'm, I, uh, it's called living within your means . Uh-huh. You know, which means at the moment, paying off the VISA bill and keeping everything else under control and hoping the car doesn't collapse . Yeah. That's true. Uh, but, uh, no don't really have a budget at the moment. Uh, but have uh, have a rough feel for how much money can afford to spend each month and then don't, usually don't exceed that unless I, unless the VISA bill gets out of hand for one reason or another, like if have car expenses and then that, then it goes through the moon, so. Yeah, that's sort of a problem. Yeah, so uh, what do yo-, We're trying, we're trying to, uh, so far we are in the clear credit wise but, uh, the other side of it is, so, not much on that side of it to add to it. We're trying to think of how to put away some savings and stuff like that but, So you can afford to get a house? Yeah, we'd like to do that some day. We have this dream. Yeah. But, we don't know how long it will be a dream. We, we're kind of real, we're real happy that we don't have any debt, but we're at the same time we're real scared about incurring it in this, uh, economy right now so … Yeah. … we're stepping real careful and trying to see what's the best way to save what, the little bit that we do get, you know, on top of expenses every month. So, what do you and your husband do? We're missionaries actually. Are you really? Yeah, uh-huh. And, uh, it will be easier once we get overseas cause we have, uh, like, uh, uh, support quota … Um. … and it's cheaper to live overseas than it is to live here. No kidding. And it doesn't get switched very easily once you come home. see. So, Overseas, where would you be going? Africa, Nigeria. Really. Yeah. Really. How long would you be there? About four years. We're career so, we, we go over seas for four years and then we come back for a year. We go over four, we come back for a year. With, with what Church? Uh, we're with Wycliff Bible Translators. Oh yes. Yes, … So. … I, uh, know who they are. They, uh, they have an office, uh, in in Costa Mesa as recall. Yeah, they could very well and, There, there was, uh, you know, there was a fairly large building that that was well that belongs to them. So, uh, are you, uh, are you, uh, active in translation? Uh, we will be. was over, over four years doing language surveying which is the first step."

And, uh, came home and got married and we will go ba-, back as translators cause we want to raise a family and it is easier to raise a family as translators. Well, always wanted to do translation, but as long as was single and foot loose so to speak it's easier. You know they really need surveyors cause you could, you're free to travel anywhere. You don't have kids hanging around you and stuff. True, true enough. So, uh, what, what, uh, what languages do you speak besides English, of course? Well, have a smattering of about ten different ones, but there's, I'm not bilingual in any of them because kept switching from one area to the other, you know, since did … Uh-huh . … you know, complete a survey in one area, I'd switch to the other. So know the greetings in about ten,. and how to do market stuff, but in about, uh, about five guess, can do better in it. And my French is pretty good but it's, uh, French so, uh, I'm terrified to speak in, uh … In France. … in France. Yeah, because they're real snobby about their language and French is street French and just picked it up off the street and knew what was, knew what was communicating, but didn't know what was saying. never sat there and got a direct translation and said something here when came home and French to somebody and he paled and said, uh, I'm not going to tell you what you said. So, since then have refrained from speaking any French . So. In . Uh, don't know what said to him but, uh, didn't ask him either. Must have been terrible. The, uh, was it Henry Macon said that the, the, uh, language was like a man slowly bleeding to death. So they hemorrhaged him to death without new infusions that will eventually die and I, it just amazes me that the French don't recognize that."

Let's just get started. Okay. If you don't want to, you know, uh, talk about it now and then … Okay. … be bored when we get to it . Okay, so just press one then right? Right. Okay, ready? Yep. Okay . So, so you think, uh, think that a short work week is real nice. Uh, have a thirty-seven hour work week. How about you? Well, well right now, I, I'm just a student. only work part time, but I've work in the job force before … Uh-huh. … and forty hours is just too long. You just don't have any time to do anything. It seems like, Saturday you get get off, but Sunday you're getting ready for Monday. And if we get have a … Uh-huh. … if we could have a thirty-two hour work week, with that happen is that, for every four people we could give another job. Right. And then that way everybody would have a three day holiday, okay. And that way that more, that would make a bigger market. We'd have, uh, more recreation. People would have time to do it. There would be less of a stress level. We'd have, we'd have less crime. We'd have to we'd have to build less prisons, you know, less police force. Yeah, it all makes sense to me. Although, there may be more crime. I mean if people have more leisure time. It's not clear. And that, It, it, that's, that's a possibility. Yeah. One, one of the problems they're facing now, a lot of people now, is that the health insurance is that the small business can't, can't offer health insurance … Uh-huh. … and it, it's too costly and what, what is happening is that they're on a policy where they have amount of users in it, okay. So they get a specific rate. Well what happens is that if people start becoming having chronic illness and, and things like that, what happened and where they really have to spend out a lot of money … Right. … for one particular, it's called a a group, well what will, well what happens then is that they cancel, because they just can't cancel an individual. So they, they have to cancel just like life insurance. They have to cancel everything. Uh-huh. So what they do is that, that they cancel the insurance and then all the people don't have any insurance coverage. Right. So, But, I'm, I'm, you know, I'm, I'm satisfied with my job. I'm, I'm an engineering student. Right. And work for my instructor and I'm I'm not a typical student."

I, just really can't deal with that so, Yeah . What kind of, what kind of jobs have you done? Well, well, do wo-, uh, research in computer science and I've just been doing that for a few years now so … Uh-huh. … uh, I, my job has most of the benefits want. Uh, what really like is, like being, like they send me to conferences for instance, but probably not as much as I'd like but, uh, you know, that's just nice being, you know, having a company being able to give you time to do that sort of thing and sort of, uh, they also, a really important thing to me is when they, uh, they pay for continuing education. Like, I, get night courses that they they'll cover right now and that's really good yeah . Yeah, that's just great. You have what you might call knowledge power … Right. … you know, when when you work at a company whether you know it or not, is that you're categorized. Some people can be let go and replaced like, uh, say, uh, a typist, uh, somebody who does data entry or answers the telephone or receptionist. But if you're a person who, that's doing computer type things and you have the, you have the knowledge, you know what the system you've revised and revamped the system, well then you're you're vital to the company … Uh-huh. … and you get more benefits so. That's where I, I, I'm like, I'm into computers too and that's one of the things that I've found in any one, one of these jobs and anything I've done is that to have knowledge. When you have the knowledge, you're you're not going to, uh, you know, be let go, be one of the last ones to let go anyway. Right."

My father likes, uh, country western music. Okay. He's from, uh, West Virginia. So that's what he grew up listening to. Uh-huh. And he's always liked it and, and, you know, he's probably about fifty-three years old now, so he grew up like in the late fifties and … Huh. … you know, when they had that, the Elvis Presley music and stuff like that. Yeah, yeah. And that kind of rock and roll so he likes that. And my mom always liked that kind of stuff. My mom likes like, uh, Doris Day, you know. Oh, really. She always had those, these old Doris Day records and stuff like that, though. Oh, well. So, you know, grew up listening to that stuff. Yeah.

/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0022_4320.utt,"Okay. So how serious is the,. subject of crime in your area? Well, needless to say, here in Washington, C this is the war zone. Uh, C around here stands for drug capital or death capital. It's, uh, it's really bad here. Uh, for example, the, uh, local high school, uh, they've already found two students with sawed off shotguns … Jeez. … and they're starting to, uh, get these hand held metal detectors so they can inspect the kids every morning when they come to school, of all things. So, Well, luckily, it hasn't gotten that bad here. Uh-huh. Uh, San Jose actually has a pretty good record in terms of being relatively low on violent crime. Uh-huh. Uh, but it's on the uprise, especially in a lot of the, uh, outlying agricultural towns. Uh-huh. Uh, because you end up having a lot of gangs forming, uh, largely around the Hispanic core. Uh-huh. Uh, it seems to be that, uh, gang warfare follows very rapidly on the heels of poverty conditions. Uh-huh, right. That's how they, uh, they bind themselves together in groups, guess and, uh, Yeah. Now, the, interestingly enough, don't think we have here, a, a lot of gangs, but, uh, only a couple, uh … Uh-huh. … of, not a whole large group of them, but, uh, just a few. Most of them centered around, uh, drug territory. Uh-huh. And so they're protecting their economic interests, guess. Yeah . And, uh, nowadays the latest thing I've, I've read about in the paper here that they're doing as far as, uh, crimes involving stealing cars is that, instead of stealing, uh, cars like at night, breaking into them or whatever, they will pick out a car that they want and wait until you show up, and then as you get out of the car, they just, uh, step up and, uh, take the keys off of you and drive the car away and leave you standing in front of your house. Well, that's efficient. Yeah, that's the, uh, latest thing. That way there's no damage to the car or anything. They just wait for you to show up after they've picked out which one they want. They're decided they're completely unworried about being identified or anything … Uh-huh. … of that sort. Right. Just wait for you to drive to your house, you get out and they get in ,. off they go with your car. Wow. So it's, uh, think they call it car jacking around here . Yeah, yeah, I'd heard that phrase. Uh-huh, yeah, that's kind of the latest thing, but , every year in the C area it gets progressively worse as far as the number of homicides, so it's, uh, it's unfortunate that we feel sometimes even that we have to bring our kids up in this area because we're not from around here, we're from, uh, I'm from Ohio and my wife's from Florida so, Uh-huh."

Yeah, there aren't that many,. places that are safe from that sort of thing nowadays. Right. And it's pretty bad when they're using metal detectors in school … Uh-huh. … and, uh, of course, the mayor, uh, of C is having a real problem, uh, trying to, what do you do to, to reduce crime in a, in a major city like C where it's a way of life for everybody. It's, uh, would hate to have to wrestle with that problem. don't know what, what the solution is. Uh, there's no way they can stop the drugs, and that's what's causing all the killing. Well, uh,. there's a couple of things that I've heard, uh, most of them are fairly, uh, radical in terms … Uh-huh. … of what you'd have to do. Uh-huh. Uh, course the, the reason that, that these kids tend to, to turn toward the drugs and everything else s-, seems to be just, you know, the, the, the end results of, of poverty and, and … Uh-huh. … parents that aren't doing any parenting and everything else because, I mean, you know, the parents aren't making a living at anything. Right . Uh, And they see all their friends and neighbors, uh, And they're accidental parents half the time anyway. Yeah, and their friends are driving Mercedes and, so it's actually, they grow up with that as their way of life and, uh, think, uh, to a large extent, they don't understand the concept that what they're doing is actually illegal because this is the way they were raised. It's illegal, but it's not wrong because all their friends do it. Right exactly, so maybe it's the law that wrong in their eyes and they … Yeah. … they say, well, it's, it's the law that's, uh, got to be changed instead of their way of life, so, don't know, it's , I'm glad it's not the kind of problem have to come up with an answer to because it's not … Well … easy. … think that the drug thing would actually be relatively easy to solve in terms of, of an actual solution to the problem. Uh … Uh-huh. … the, the social, the other social problems wouldn't, wouldn't go away. Right. Uh, They've always been with us. I mean, there's, there's been a lot of, uh, and used to think that this whole argument was completely bogus, but then, the … Uh-huh. … more thought about it, the more sense it made, is that, uh, alcohol is as bad a drug as anything else.

Capital punishment, uh, the problem have with capital punishment is that, uh, uh, it's supposed to be a deterrent to crime, but don't think that it really actually does that. don't think it deters anybody, because most of the time crimes are, uh, are committed with a, without any thought to the consequences and they don't think that, uh, stop and think and say, well, maybe shouldn't do this, uh, because, uh, might get the gas chamber or something like that. They worry about it afterwards and then they try and get out of it. And, uh, how about you ? Well, think that in some cases, it is warranted. Uh-huh, do, too, yep. And don't, think in some cases it doesn't matter if it's a deterrent or not. Uh-huh, yeah, you still have to do it. I, I mean … I, … I mean, I'm thinking of an extreme case like a serial murderer … Uh-huh. … or, So you're in, you're in favor of capital punishment, then. Well, for some things. Right. think for serial murder … Uh-huh. … it is warranted because if a person who would do something like that in cold … Uh-huh. … blood, Needs to be punished or, uh, eliminated from society. I mean,. you can't guarantee that they wouldn't escape … Right. … from prison … And then do it all over again. … and do it again. Uh-huh. And don't think that, that rehabilitation is effective. Right. Have to agree with you, and I'm kind of i-, in favor of capital punishment also. just don't think that it acts much as a deterrent to these people because, uh, you still see them committing the same crimes, but, tend to agree with you that, uh, we should have it . just, don't know that it's always effective , but guess we, uh, we're kind of stuck with it. It's, it's a difficult, uh, problem, isn't it, to determine how you're going to punish somebody for a particular crime, uh, But, then, you know, think that, that some murderers don't really warrant capital punishment. Uh-huh. You know,. just, like, for example, uh, you know, you hear about cases where women have killed their husbands … Uh-huh. … who abused them … Right, uh-huh. … and don't think,. that would really warrant capital punishment. Uh-huh, huh. Do you think they should be punished at all, or, uh, like go to prison, uh, because they're not really a danger to society. It was almost really self defense, isn't it, in a case like that. Uh , it is to a certain extent … Uh-huh. … but think, don't know because, know they put, uh, put them in jail sometimes, guess.

Uh-huh. You know, now, wonder what you think about this and, uh, unfortunately, we, we don't get to do it, but, uh, it used to be a long time ago, guess in Biblical times when they had punishment , if somebody did something, for example, to your family, then you had the right to administer the punishment. So if somebody killed somebody in your family , then you had the right to, uh, if that person was caught and found guilty, you had the right to, uh, execute that person. And know that, uh, if somebody had done something to my family, would feel that had the right to, to get revenge on them and, uh, but, I, don't think that's done much anywhere . That's kind of drastic punishment. Well, think that would be kind of drastic punishment. Right. And, Might make you feel better but , But, one thing, think that if there is a chance for rehabilitation … Uh-huh. … then that chance sh-, should be investigated. Right. But, like said, if, if someone is, is just pathologically … Uh-huh. … going to murder people no matter what … Right. … then think they should be eliminated from … Uh-huh. … society.

Right, probably more of them then the other way around . Interesting. don't, don't, not sure - I, I'm in Washington, C or at least very close to it.

So it's sort of helps defray the costs a little bit. But, you know, we do a lot of robbing Peter to pay Paul. guess we're in the situation that a lot of am-, middle-class Americans are in. Uh-huh. Yeah, you're the first, you know, uh, my next door neighbor just lost his job. Oh, my Lord. In a, you know, one of these, uh, his company went broke. I mean went, you know, bankrupt. Actually, it was a subsidiary of a, of an outfit called S Shoe or something. I-, i-, it was a computer subsidiary. don't know what a shoe company's doing running a computer company. Really. But, uh, you know, they just folded it up and, uh, uh, told him to, they took the top management and gave them jobs … Uh-huh. … with the, with the corporate, uh, at the corporate front office and everybody else was sent packing. Oh . Uh, hang on one second I've got … Sure. … uh, somebody was knocking on my door here. Uh, it sounds like, in a certain sense, at least at the present, I mean, it sounds, sounds terrible to say, but at the present stage, you probably are even more in the market for a, a budgetary thing than, than most people probably ar-, might be. Right. In terms of keeping, keeping score of input and output. Uh-huh. Definitely. Do you have, do you have a computer at home or, Uh, yes we do. And we try … Uh-huh. … to, you know, keep track of every penny. Uh-huh. And, more or less, enter it in. Every single day I'm at the computer. see. And, it's like, okay, what do we have left,. what do we have to pay, what … Uh-huh. … have we paid this month. What hasn't come in yet, you know . Yeah."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0025_2451.utt,"Okay, this topic is, is Russia a threat to our security?. think they are more of a threat to their own people at this day and time., how do you feel about it?. Well, they do have, uh, a major internal problem . Everybody wants to defect, and can understand why. Um, think their biggest problem is just, you know, obtaining food to live, so when you have the basic needs, uh,. being unmet , don't think you think globally as far as, you know, being a threat to other people in the world. So, as soon as they get their, their own home country taken care of, then they'll consider,. what they can do with the rest of the world. believe Communism is very much waning . It's, uh, pretty much on the way out of the door, insofar as the strong hold that they used to have, and the Russian people are all realizing that the Communist system does not work to their satisfaction or their way of surviving in this world, and their rebellions right now is the result of that . If they can get the army,. or the military to sway to their side, think that, uh, it will be on the way out eventually. It's just a matter of time, because,. in the Baltic States they have already massacred so many people who protested,. and that hasn't set too well with their diplomacy for the, regarding the, uh, outcome of their affairs . What's your synopsis?. Well, do, do realize that, uh, uh, the Bush Administration isn't too happy with, with how they're handling their internal, uh, strife, you know, as far as diplomacy is concerned . think it's been a good, a good positive direction for uh, the Soviets as far as Yeltsin is concerned. You know, he was, uh, allowed to, what, wh-, in his, in the Congress they, they gave him more power as far as his republic in Russia is concerned, which is, gives him more power overall, which think is a good sign that there will be some, you know, politically speaking, you know, he's going to have more power, and think it's a step in the right direction. think Gorbachev realizes that he's got a, a major uh, uh, power figure, you know, competing against him, and think it's going to be pretty close to his demise if he doesn't follow suit with Yeltsin as far as, uh, realizing, well, he does realize it, you know, with the fact that they reduced the uh, or they, increased the prices on their food, food and goods. Uh-huh. Uh. think that it went up a thousand percent on most, It, yeah. Tha-, that's incredible but they had to, uh, go in the direction of a market driven economy, and, and they had to bite the bullet for that."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0025_2451.utt,"So that's a good move , on, on Gorbachev's part in doing that. Uh-huh . So, but Gorbachev has still not fully convinced everyone that,. he's moving towards a two to three party system of government that, nor eliminating or diminishing the Communist power, and guess that's where Yeltsin steps in, so far as his politics of government goes, uh, but don't know how convinced the people are of him yet, myself. Well, that's all they got right now. That's their ray of hope. Uh-huh. So, you know, they'll go with ,. you know, whoever comes through for them. I, it, it's just that,. the weird thing is, is that Gorbachev is the one that opened the floodgates, as far as with glasnost and poistro-, perestroika and stuff, and think he's got between the Old Guard and, and the new, uh, glasnost. Uh, think it's kind of escalated to a point where it's out of control. Uh-huh. And think he had to pull in the reins the only way he knew how, in order to keep the peace on, peace on both sides. So think that's where you know, kind of where he's stuck. You know what I'm saying? Yeah. Uh, understand. And that's the, that's the situation that he finds himself in, and you know, he's a tough guy, I mean, he's been through it . So have no doubt that he'll, I mean, I, think overall he's been a, a , good figure for the Soviet Union. I mean, think his intentions and his ideals are, are uh, well intentioned. Uh-huh. And in the long-term, but just think that because of the basic needs that the people don't have, think that, uh, makes the problem most severe, and makes him look, look worse that what his, um, what his ideals are,. personally. agree. What's bad for the Soviet system is that , they have the resources to grow and produce their food, but somehow it just does not get out to the market the way it should. think it's, think it's a lot of, uh, oh, how do you put it?, bureaucracy and, and, uh, one thing, and then all the corruption. think there's a, a large amount of corruption on the, the have and the have-nots. Yeah . That's probably more true than, You know, … a lot of people realize. … know you're going to have that with every society. At least we're more blatant about it, but it's very secret, and it's been going on for years. I mean, you can't change things overnight. Uh-huh. And, but if it gets to a point where people can't , survive, I mean, there's revolution. You know, and that's , It seems to be headed in that direction too. Yeah , big time , major , but you know, that's, that's what happens when, you know, the cork blows and you can't handle it anymore."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0025_2451.utt,"I mean, that's … Uh-huh. … that's the way the world, uh, you know, revolves that way . Anyway, Well, their knowledge , with, uh, better communication processes in this world now that's reached them is more educated than to the, uh, ways of the western world, and uh, think that was a big stepping stone for them to initiate all their righteous ways of changing things, too. really question, though, how much technology the average Soviet is exposed to. They, probably not enough, but I'm sure lot of it's filtered down enough to the common folks that they have gotten wind , of what they're missing out on. Yeah, think they're starting to realize, but I, just don't think they have the resources, if you were to compare, uh, the Americans to the Soviets as far as home computers are concerned or fact machines, Fax machines and cellular phones, and state of the art equipment that we are so used to. don't think they even realize what's out there, and to what extent. Yeah, I'm sure a lot of them are missing those household items . Yeah, the major conveniences of life . Yeah what we consider just, don't , normal everyday things to them is real luxury. Yeah . Which is unfortunate for them, and of course, most of us, we don't really appreciate what we've got because we've been so used to it. This is true. This is very true. And we, it's human, it's human nature though to take things for granted and it kind of,. you know, when you've lost something or, or uh, uh, don't have what other people have that's when you tend to realize, you know, what's out there and what, you know, what you have and what you don't have. Yeah agree . So the original question, do we think their a threat to our, you know, a security threat? Yeah. Um, yes and no. Yeah, can go with that answer too . The only yes could go to is if uh, a renegade crew decides to launch an attack or an accidental launching or something to that effect to, to a nuclear exchange, but don't even see that occurring. Um, no. Uh, because their internal strifes are more important right now than concentrating on any kind of outside affairs that they used to be adapted to guess. Well, don't really feel that the Soviets really want to blow up the world. I mean, um, we painted them back in the fifties and sixties as, as nonfeeling machine type people, and they're people just like us. I mean … Uh-huh. … you know, they get up everyday, and they put their pants on the same way, and they have to eat and everything else, and just don't feel that …"
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0026_3902.utt,"Okay. Well why don't you start cause it said was suppose to ask you what do you, Do you have any elderly relatives currently in an, uh, nursing home now? Yes, do. Do you? have a grandmother. She's a hundred and two. Oh my gosh. She'll be a hundred and three in August. Uh-huh. And we decide not to put her in a nursing home. She lives with my mother and my father who also live here in town and then my sister takes care of her. Uh-huh. She, even though she is a hundred and two, she still has all of her faculties. Right. She still has her snap. She takes care of her own business. This is the first year that she has gotten weak and actually has to have a little walker, but with somebody that needs around the clock care, have seen my family age. Right. have seen them in the, she's been there ten years now. And have seen them age twenty … Yeah. … in the time and, and with the expense and everything, th-, still think it is worth it if you, if you had a good nursing home and they needed some quality care, would … Right. … put someone in a nursing home. My mother-in-law finally. They had to make a family decision. There's seven children in my husband's family and fortunately four of them live in the same home town and she has Alzheimer's. It was getting where she was getting th-, dangerous. I mean … Uh-huh. … letting strangers in and things like this, but they were very fortunate. It's a small town and she happens to room with one of the doctor's mother's and … Oh, well that's good. … then she's got a lot of family there and that go and see her all of the time but she really doesn't. Nobody thought she would adjust, but she has adjusted beautifully. Oh, that is great. But then am also facing my father who is very sick and my mother and father reside in Colorado. She's been taking care of him. don't know how much longer this can last and at that point because he requires round the clock. He can't do anything without her. He doesn't know when to take his medicine and it's really sad and have thought if something would happen to my mother for, uh, my brother's are not interested in helping me so would have to move him down here. That way, want to see the nursing home. If have to put him into one. You know, where can go see it. I, I'd be very uncomfortable with him being in Colorado. And, Oh, why yeah. am sure you have got some really good nursing homes around Dallas. Yes. And some of them are limited care too where people can do, uh, like they have apartment styles, but that wouldn't work for him."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0026_3902.utt,"think he is beyond that. Where if you need help you can get it, but basically people kind of have a small apartment and doctor's are available if they need them. Uh-huh. I, … And allows, … know a lady that lives in a place similar … Yeah. … to that in Austin. Yeah. Well, the only problem with these are that they are very expensive. Of course, guess all nursing homes there is but, And the bad thing about it, before you can get any kind of government help, you just practically have, well you have to be a pauper. Right. It, it takes every penny. They want you to spend every dime you have … Yeah. … before the government will pay for your your care. Right. And that's the sad part about it. Yeah. I, uh, yeah, and think a lot of people who do it now. In Colorado it's interesting. talked to my mother. They allow you sixty five thousand dollars and your car and your home. And my mother could make it on that. What she probably would do is disburse the money to me and then would send it back to her so that's what would happen. Uh-huh. think that's what most people do. You just have to give it, everything away. Yeah. It's unfortunate. I, work at a brokerage firm and have seen so many people that just have to gift, you know, their belongings … Right. … as much as they can each year in anticipation of having to move to a nursing home. Yeah. It's frightening. And guess, uh, don't know how old you are. I'm forty-six. You know, we're the generation moving into this and don't know how our kids are going to take care of us. can't imagine. You know. I'm twenty-nine. Yeah. And everybody in my family has always had, we don't have any children. Everybody that has, has them later in life. Yeah. So, my, my mother and my father are in their late sixties. So, I mean, they're not … Right. … that far away. also see on my generation a squeeze between looking to having to help my parents and still having to help my son because things are so rough out there job wise and he's still living at home and don't know how he is ever going to get on his own the way things are. Oh, know. And so, it's kind of, you feel squeezed in the middle of having both generations, but it, something will have to change as more and more of us get older. Uh, luckily, if we could be like your grandmother, I, uh you know, would love to live to a hundred and two if were okay. But … It, but yeah. … you see these people in their seventies … Most people aren't. … yeah, most aren't. That's the problem. And that's the bad thing."

/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0027_4096.utt,"Hello Ann. Hello Chuck. Uh, the other day, attended a conference here at Utah State University on recycling … Uh-huh. … and, uh, was kind of interested to hear cause they had some people from the P and lots of different places … Uh-huh. … and, uh, they had basically decided that there is going to be a real problem here within a few years on solid waste. Uh, didn't think that was a new revelation. Well, it's not too new. Right. So, what what is the P recommending now? Oh, they really didn't propose any solutions. Actually, they were, the guy was pretty negative about the things that the government was doing even though he was from the P Uh-huh. But, he had a lot of, uh, facts to, to give and, uh, things like how many solid waste plants were being shut down and, and, uh, one of the most interesting things that he was talking about was recycling of, of news print. He was talking about, uh, the City of New York and how they went and collected all this news print … Yeah. … and they could sell it for a while. They were able to sell it for some amount per ton and now at this stage of the game where they have gotten into recycling, they've collected so much news print that they have to pay to have it hauled away. Right. That's a, that's a common problem though. That it seems, that has happened in Dallas as well as New York and try to recycle all of the newspapers that come to my house and after a while just quit taking the newspaper because couldn't recycle it anymore which isn't good for business on the other end either, suppose. Yeah. We're doing some here in, in Cash Valley, the community here. Uh-huh. There's, uh, we've actually got a kind of a nice set up. We've got a couple of plants here that actually take, uh, recycled paper and shred it and spray it with chemical treatment so that it's not a fire hazard … Right. … and make it into insulation and they can actually use as much recycled paper as the community can get to them. Because they are actually buying it and shipping it in from outside. Well, that's good. So one of the real keys, it sounds like, to getting recycling for, uh, paper or something like that to go is to get some sort of business to actually want it once you have collected it. Right. There has to be, uh, a reuse for it. I mean, that's why they recycle. The one think is the most interesting is with the recycled bottles and all that, uh, the industry seems to be doing with the recycled polymers. Uh, everything from, uh, waste baskets to carpet to the no stick, I mean the sticky slide rugs under the carpet …"
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0027_4096.utt,"Uh-huh. … and, uh, think they are even putting it in the roadways these days and they're making clothes now that are recycled. Like the recycled plastic coke bottles and and milk cartons and things like that. And there was a paper presented at this conference from a guy from Alabama and he was kind of hired to do a study by two departments for the government. One was like, environmental protection and the other one was, oh, can't remember what, but the basic idea, it was presented to him was how can we maximize the amount of energy that we can get back from recycling and minimize the volume of stuff that we are putting into our landfill … Uh-huh. … and, uh, the solution that he came up with for plastics, and it was really quite amazing, he says, well the best thing to do with plastics is to burn them. Oh really. He came to the conclusion, plastics is actually one of the biggest problems in landfills cause it's, it's low weight, but it's high volume so it takes up a lot of space … Right. … and there's almost no energy, there's very little energy value in actually doing a lot of the recycling, but there is a lot of energy in it if you can burn it and use it, produce electricity. Huh. So his solution was to burn plastic. Collect it and burn it. Well, it's carbon so that makes sense, like a carbon fuel of some sort, but … Yeah. … what … And it's more than even paper or something like that. There is more energy in it per pound or whatever. … what about emissions? Well that was he didn't deal with that. Oh. He just said burn it. Okay . He didn't talk about cleaning it up or anything like that. So it's not very practical . No. Well it's interesting. bet that was a good day, at the yeah, conference then. Yeah, well, real interesting. Did it change anything for you? Uh, not too much. Uh, got a bit."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0028_4133.utt,"So, uh, you know, my feeling is that, uh, it's really being used today, it, it, you know, it, it really isn't doing any real good purpose for anything because it's not cost effective because of the amount of time the people end up waiting on appeal. Right, think I've seen some statistics that say that, uh, it's more expensive to kill somebody than to keep them in prison for life. Right because y-, you, you've got all, all the prison expenses, plus all the legal expenses. Right. Uh, and, you know, it certainly doesn't seem to be a deterrent. Uh, for one thing because it's used so infrequently and for another thing because honestly don't think the people that are committing the c-, crimes that would be eligible, you know, really care. Well, that's, committing them mostly is, you know, either crimes of passion or at the moment or they think they're not going to get caught or, Right, I mean, it's kind of like the AIDS phenomenon, you know, I'm invulnerable, don't need to care about this. You know, I, I, I'm … Yeah, b-, … never going to get caught. Yeah, but you also have to think whether it's worthwhile on the individual basis, for example, someone like, uh, Jeffrey Dahlmer, do you want, by putting him in prison for life, there is still a possibility that he will get out again. Yeah, one, one … Whereas … way or another. … if you kill him, there is not that possibility. Yeah, but, but the other side to that is, if you put him in prison for life, there's a chance that he might do things in prison, or, you know, and somehow redeem himself. Yeah, don't think he could ever redeem himself, but … Well, … in some cases, yes. You know, so that, you know, the, the question is, you know, the other qu-, problem with capital punishment you run into is, what are you going to do about people who are later to have been found innocent, you know? There are cases where, you know, twenty, thirty years after the fact of getting evidence, especially as new technology comes along that might prove their innocence, then, oops, I'm sorry, guess we killed the wrong guy. Yeah, it's, it's, yeah, once you've made a decision that way, it's a little difficult to go back on it. Right, you, you can apologize nicely, but, you know, you know, think, you know, the, the price, you know, it, I've heard quotes, you know, it's better that a thousand people go free, than one person be unjustly imprisoned. think i-, is really the, the philosophy of the way our legal system works. Oh, yeah, yeah, it's a-, the benefit of the doubt to the last iota is, uh, based on the, uh, person who is accused."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0028_4133.utt,"Yeah, and, you know, the, I, think that, you know, and the way it's being used now, it's like you listen to Bush is, you know, well, where are we going to impose d-, you know, it's like for drug dealers is the new big thing like in, Tsongas is also saying, you know, capital, make it a capital crime to be a major drug dealer. Right. And, again, don't thing these people care. typo - replace thing with think They risk their lives every day. Yeah, and, there, there, they seem that the profit marg-, uh, drug dealers, the profit margin's so high that, yeah … Yeah. … the, the risk is almost not there. Yeah, and, and, you know, uh, especially, now, live in, in Massachusetts, you know, w-, w-, we're going to get capital punishment here probably after the second coming or something. Yeah. So, you know, but you look at our, our crime rates and things like that and you compare them to, to like Texas or someplace that does, you know, it, it, it's impossible to make a case that it's, it's affecting it in any way. Yeah. think it's mainly, people, like, they get the vengeance of it. Yeah, well … Because, you know, … it's also, used to live in Georgia and, you know, the, the big thing down there was, all right, we have capital punishment, but if you look at who gets accused and who are the ones who actually get executed, it's very racially related … Oh, yeah … and ethnically related, … it's mainl-, lot of blacks. Also a lot of young people. You know, a, a, a sixty-two year old guy is less likely to be put on death row from what I've seen. Right. And, you know, I, think when you listen to like the, uh, the, the victims' families and things, they're always talking about, you know, uh, feeling justified or feeling, you know, like they've gotten something out of it, I mean, my thought has been, once the guy has been imprisoned, if he goes to jail forever or whatever, if he gets killed, it shouldn't make any difference to the, uh, the victim's family. The only thing that should really, I mean, obviously, if someone of mine who has close died, I'd probably feel differently, but … Right. … you know, th-, you know, what, the important thing is that they be caught and not be a danger to society. Right and that, and, you know, also by keeping them in prison, you do have the possibility, though, we don't currently do this, of making restitution. Right, mean, the , You, you will work your prison job and any money you earn will go to the victim's family. Right and, the, the other thing is that, you know, was reading through a book on, uh, geneo, human geneo research …"
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0028_4133.utt,"Uh-huh. … and there, more and more things like schizophrenia - and why, does it just turn out to be genetic or biochemical in origin. Right. So if someday we can go to Jeff Dahlmer and say, well, the problem is you, you've got an endorphin imbalance and, you know, if you take this regularly, you'll be a sane and productive member of society … Uh-huh. … you know, you really get back to the question of, you know, is someone responsible for their actions. Yeah, well, I, think on some of it, you have to say someone's responsible for his actions. never like the, uh, … Society made me do it. … the defense, Yeah.

Yes. Yeah. Th-, the one of which was, uh, something, something that's been going on because of the Rodney King trial here in town and that is, uh, and that is the exclusion of jurors because of or in spite of their race. Uh, Oh, really? Yeah. Well, they, they, uh, the, the people that - the, uh, the jury that's trying, uh, the officers in that case, Uh-huh. is, is an all white panel. And there's been a lot made in the local papers of that, see. fact. can't, I'm a little surprised they didn't get a change of venue on that one. They have. They have. They moved it up to the county north of here. Oh. Um, it's in Ventura and there's, there's still quite a bit of publicity obviously, and it's kind of, it's kind of debatable whether you could get a fair trial almost anywhere because that, uh, that, Well, that videotape was just horrible. Yeah. It was everywhere. Yes. So you know, and I, think it would be very difficult to find someone, uh, find a panel that would be, not have seen it and, and known of what was going on. Oh, agree with you but can't imagine that they would do an all white jury without having some sort of, of discrimination or, or, you know, uh, appeal on not having a jury of his peers and all of that kind of stuff. Exactly. You know, um, the you know, I, I'm kind of torn on this issue. It's like they're saying well on the one hand they're not, he's not getting a jury of his peers which is in some ways think true. But on the other hand, it's, it's also saying that white jurors are not going to, are not going to convict. Right. Uh, you know, they're not going to do their job. Which is - the whole, the whole point of being on a jury is to convict or, or, or, uh, let go based on whether, Exactly. or not the person, whether or not the evidence says, Based on fact. Right. that there's enough , How interesting. Oh. So what's the prevailing thought within the community? Um, I mean you know, what the news media is going to make of it, but what about the community? They, well, guess it depends on who you talk to. haven't talked to, uh, haven't talked to a whole lot of black people on it but I, rather imagine there's, there's some snickering about it."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0029_4152.utt,"And a lot of the usually fatalistic, uh, here we go again folks, Uh-huh. kind of stuff. Oh, my goodness. That can't be good for Los Angeles either. No, no.

There was a girl out here named Latausha Harlins . don't know if it's, it's got, it's got as much notoriety but it's rather almost as infamous here as it was, as it was with, uh, the Rodney King problem. Um, a girl walked into a Korean owned store and, uh, they, she had a dispute, black girl. Uh-huh. She, she had some kind of a dispute over some orange juice with the, with the owner of the store.

/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0030_4166.utt,"Okay. Uh, before a couple of years ago, had a, a very narrow view of, of nursing homes and it was, uh, more like a funeral home. always joked around about it being a funeral home and not really a nursing home. And, uh, then had to do some volunteer work here in Tyler, Texas and went to one and it just had a very good activities director. Everyone was cheerful and now don't have such a bad view of nursing homes anymore. But I, certainly wouldn't want to send my parent unless it was an absolute last re-, resort. Uh, have a sister that is in nursing school and she's real interested in geriatrics. Well, that sounds good. Yeah. So, uh, she, she's real interested in, uh, what Ann Richards has been doing. She's, Ann Richards is really cracking down on, uh, the nursing homes and, don't know, you wouldn't know anything about a Texas governor . I've heard the name and that's about all it goes. Okay. Ann Richards is our governor in Texas and she's really cracking down on restrictions and what goes on in nursing homes. And, uh, my sister's real interested in that and, and getting into the, to that side of nursing. Yeah. That's one problem with the, the nursing home environment. It, the elderly, even out of the nursing home, are very open to abuse. Right. Uh, you know, they don't always have their full wits about them. Uh-huh. They're not completely up on what should be going on or what's not going on. Uh-huh. And it can be pretty sad. I've got a, had a grandmother who had a stroke. And she was in a nursing home for four or five years before she died. Oh. And, you know, it's the type of thing that she was living down in Florida. My in-, families was up in Maryland … Uh-huh. … and the other part of her family was up in, uh, New York state. Right. And, you know, it was very difficult for either them or my grandfather to take care of her since she was, uh, you know, could not do very much for herself after the stroke. Right. And, you know, the nursing home was the, you know, best facility to put her in. Uh-huh. You know, besides moving her up which is not a practical solution since both my parents work and both my, uh, aunts and uncle work. Right. Which means it's, you know, very difficult for some-, you essentially need to have someone taking care of the person full-time. Right. And, you know, there's also a lot of medical problems that can't always be completely handled in the home. Right. Which makes it, you know, it's a necessary evil think. Uh-huh. It sure is. And some of the really nice ones that really take care of their people are so expensive."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0030_4166.utt,"Because … Yeah. … cause they can afford to hire the people that are really going to care for the older. Yeah. And, you know, even there you have to watch out for, you know, you get one person who's a little bit dishonest working in there and, you know, the elderly sometimes have a lot of jewelry … Oh, yeah. … and other stuff that just very easily tends to disappear in the nursing homes. Right. My grandfather passed away several years ago. was much younger. But, uh, he was in the nursing home the last several years of his life and someone visited him every day. My grandmother did. But, uh, if she couldn't, someone visited him every day. It was in a very small town nursing home. Uh-huh. And, uh, people didn't get paid much there at all. They didn't care about what went on. Yeah. They would let a, let a patient get a lot of bed sores. Uh-huh. And, uh, the, the people living in the nursing home would have all kinds of needs that wouldn't get met because they were just old people. And then, the nurses and doctors really didn't put any for, forth any loving care for them. Either that or they're just so understaffed that they can't afford … Right. … to put in the, uh, care that they need. Right. Cause it's, you know, an elderly person can, you know, it's like a newborn baby. You need … Uh-huh. … to have twenty-four hour care … Right. … uh, answering all the needs cause they can't do much for themselves at certain points. Right. And nurses get so worn down. Uh-huh. And, you know, there's a lot of, number of - the elderly are very, you know, complaining because they remember the way that things used to be. Right. And remember being able to do things for themselves which, you know, they no longer can. Oh, sure. And they feel … And it, very, very hard for them to accept that. … they feel pretty helpless. We just, uh, moved my grandfather into, not a nursing home but, you know, a transitional type facility. Is it, uh, like a retirement center? More of a retirement home. He's got his own efficiency apartment. Uh-huh. And they provide one meal a day. Uh-huh. And, you know, the rest of the housekeeping and other meals a day are up to him. Uh-huh. But they do have, you know, group activities going on. How's he handling that? Uh, he'd much rather be living alone in his apartment down in Florida. Uh-huh. Uh, you know, to move into that facility we moved him from Florida up to Maryland and … Ooh. … it's, it's a bit of a shock to the system, weather-wise, if nothing else. Oh, sure."

The dental plan, pay absolutely nothing because, uh … Wow. … I, guess they would charge a little bit if there was some orthodontia or something for one of my dependents or something like that … Uh-huh. … but … Uh-huh. … that's not the case, so, guess nothing.

/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0032_4333.utt,"Steve, uh, with the election year and whatnot coming up, do you think we ought to cut taxes, raise them, or, or, or what do you think? Well, that's, that's a really hard question. do know that, uh, politicians always talking out of both sides of their mouths. Uh, let's example, uh, our friend, the President, right now, says no new taxes, we should and especially, if anything, be cutting taxes now because of the recession and at the same time, the budget he sent to Congress has tax and fee increases, so, uh, know the politicians, uh, aren't, aren't straightforward. Now, i-, in terms of economics I'm not, it's hard, hard to call. It really is. Uh-huh. See, never thought really, it's, uh, never really thought that, that the, the question really had to do whether or not we're paying too much or too little. I, always that the, the real question was is, are we getting a reasonable return on, on investment. For instance, like Social Security tax or Soc-, uh, I mean, that's, that's tax we're paying money and, and supposedly this money is going into some kind of fund so that when it comes our turn to retire, the money will be there for us. Right. So that's, yeah, you know, when I, when see that money taken out of my paycheck each, each week, I, or each, every other week, I, really think that money's history and … Yes, uh, … you know, so as far as return investment, that's not, that's nothing and we're not even going to get the exact same number of dollars back. Uh, someone was telling me that there is a, uh, uh, there's still an office in, uh, you know, staffed with, with people there and, in C that are researching to find a cure for polio, which, may be wrong, but believe that the cure for polio is already founded, but, but supposedly once you have an office in C, or, you know, and, and staff it with people, it's really tough to close it down and, and they just haven't yet. Well, yeah, I'm not exactly sure, uh, about polio in particular. know we have a polio vaccine come will prevent somebody from getting polio … Uh-huh. … I'm not sure if we know what to do in terms of curing some who has already gotten polio. Well, that might be the difference. don't know. Uh, the other thing that, uh, remember seeing on V lately is, uh, had to do with, it's like seventy-five percent of the historical sites in America are in the home districts of very powerful people politically … Right. … that, that histor-, for some reason, historical sites with, you know, the, the full federal money and everything seem to appear as, as almost as like political favors to, to very strong politicians."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0032_4333.utt,"Yeah, it's, it's, it's funny because, uh, it was one of the things that Bush is trying really hard to get ahold of is the line item veto where, uh, you know, Congress is able to attach all kinds of, uh, funny amendments for individual, uh, c-, congressional districts … Uh-huh. … to the, to the main budget proposals and the poor President has, has to, uh, either accept or reject the whole thing. So, it sounds like you, uh, you think that, that we'd be able to save some money by, uh … Oh. … passing the line item veto. I, think the line item veto is not, not, is not necessarily a bad thing, assuming that the, uh, the, the President, uh, uses it to get rid of, uh, this kind of waste. On the other hand, uh, it, it assumes that you have lots of confidence in your President not to veto important things. Yeah. Uh, and just to get rid of the unimportant things. And whenever there's that kind of subjective judgment, there's always going to be a dispute … Uh-huh. … as to, uh, where the exa-, where the boundary between waste and, and necessity is. So I'm not, I'm not sure that, that that will help solve our problems, but there definitely is, is a problem with, uh, forgot, there's a political term for this stuff, pork barrel or something. Yeah. Uh, Pork barrel politics. Pork barrel politics. The-, the-, there has to be some way to do it. know state governors usually have line item vetos and, uh, lived in Massachusetts for a while and, uh, when Dukakis vetoed certain things, there was a big uproar and wasn't necessarily so popular. Yeah, but Massachusetts wasn't, when Dukakis was there, anyway, wasn't in that great shape financially. D-, at least at the end. Uh-huh. I mean, don't know, I, Yeah, i-, i-, they were very good at first, they were in very good financials at first and, uh, that's part of the reason he became a nominee is because things went so well. And then, of course, the bottom fell out. It's, uh, I mean, it's, it's tough. I mean, there's, there's two ways you can kind of go to get out of tough financial situations. guess you can like raise taxes and then create like job programs and whatnot or you can hope that if people keep their money that they'll spend more and create jobs and, and whatnot. And spare the economy. Yeah, it's really, it's a hard balance. It, it definitely is. Even not for government, even just, say, for a small business."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0033_4336.utt,"Uh, well, I'm not sure how it is in Georgia, but in, in Pittsburgh the r-, the crime rate really is not very high at the moment. Is that, is that true for, for Atlanta? Atlanta is kind of high. Uh, it's, it's lower than it has been in the past. Uh, guess nineteen ninety is when it start to drop off, and usually around the Christmas season is usually when the crime rate is a little bit higher. Yeah, I, that's probably not true only for Atlanta, but for just about anywhere. Yeah. Uh, what kind of crime problem do you usually run into? Any specifics ? Well, uh, the least, what, from what's on the news, uh, there are very few, like actual robberies reported, uh, uh, of, of residences. What's more likely to occur is, uh, robbery of, uh, you know, knocking over a, a small store or a car theft, you know, it, things of that nature. Very few, uh, assaults, although on the college campuses, uh, there are, uh, cases of, you know, like people getting machine from a, from an automated teller and, you know, somebody trying to, to device a scam for, for, uh, getting the money for them that actually preys mostly on foreigners. Um. But mostly petty things and, n-, no, nothing, nothing really too big. Right, well, guess here we run into that sometime, but guess a lot of crimes are done with apartment type break ins … Right. … that type, not much home break ins. There are some, but not, not very high. Uh, as far as tellers and things like that, it's not extremely high either. There were one case where, uh, this one guy, uh, was taking women from the teller and, and, you know, making them give him money and stuff and … Uh-huh. … then at the same time, raping them all, so, so that's kind of like a double assault there. Yeah, uh, a strange case that, uh, that happened, oh, it's about, about a year ago was someone actually stole a complete automated teller machine. Really? It was a free standing machine and they backed up into it with a truck … Uh-huh. … and put it on the back and drove away with it. Oh, wow. Now, there's a crime for you. Yeah, there's a crime. Yeah, but, uh, guess most of the things that happen around here are, are pretty, uh, innocuous. Although, uh, from what hear in the news, and, and I, s-, saw an episode of the V show, COPS … Uh-huh. … uh, one time that was in Pittsburgh, and, uh, it, it, it did surprise me, because, you know, they were doing drug arrests and thing, and things like that, but I, don't really think those things happen too often because, like said, from what's reported in the news, at least, it's, it's not all that common."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0033_4336.utt,"Oh, okay. don't know, crime situations here, they, like say, lot of, lot of cases is usually just apartments and, and break ins and things like that and a lot of it is due to drugs. Yeah. Uh, drug related, you know, in, in most cases, it's not like, uh, it's someone do steal a, a or television or C or something like that it is for drugs, you know, because you really can't on the street make any money off of it per se, you know, you going to get ten or fifteen bucks for it … Yeah. … so you really not making a sizeable profit. So it's not really lucrative to take chances like that, you know, even though it, it does exist. You know, I, just to diverge a little bit, uh, live in an apartment. Right now I'm finishing out my last semester at the University of Pittsburgh and, uh, the apartment like would be very easy for just about anyone to break in . Right. But, even so, it, I mean, it's, it's still difficult for me to convince my apartment mates to, to like lock the doors when they go out , you know, and things like … Yeah. … that. Uh-huh. Uh, it would be so easy for someone who is motivated to do so to just, you know, sit out back, take a look at when people are here and when they're not … Uh-huh. … just come in, you know, there's a V and a C and, they could, uh, they could get in pretty easy and, and especially, uh, since there are bedrooms upstairs … Uh-huh. … and people leave the door open, you know, while they're upstairs playing music, it could still happen then.

Do you think, then, that, uh, the American media is presenting an opinion along with their facts? Uh, very much so, very much so, and I, think a lot of it is, uh, especially V news, they don't really have the time and a lot of them don't have the education and the background to,. uh, oh, to really decipher the news and to really explain it. I mean, I, you know, think it's important to interpret it, but a lot of times the person doesn't have the experience to, to do the interpreting. Uh-huh. Which, uh, which approach do you find to be, uh, more useful, the, the interpretive approach or the straight reporting? Oh, like the straight reporting.

And a lot of time don't hear exactly what they, what they write into it. Uh-huh. So I, overall, think would rather hear just straight reporting. One of the things that found interesting last year during the, uh, the Gulf conflict was a sentiment against, uh, Peter Arnett, who had stayed in Iraq and was presenting, uh, some of the things that were available. Uh, there was a, there was, uh, a piece where he was showing a bombed out building where there was obviously a crudely, uh, uh, hastily erected sign saying baby milk factory, and while he was being severely, uh, censored and could not make any judgment call on this, it was fairly obvious that it was a piece of propaganda, but people were really down on him for reporting the fact that, th-, you know, this isn't a baby milk factory, how could he say it was, uh, I, think that,. that to me showed that the Americans were really getting used to having the, not just the facts, but also the conclusions and opinions spoon fed to them.

/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0035_4372.utt,"So, let's talk about the, uh, wonderful abuses in the State of Pennsylvania of personal property taxes whereby you can purchase something mail order and after the fact, the State of Pennsylvania can find out about it and send you a bill for the sales tax appropriate to that item that you purchased as well as interest and penalties from the time that you bought it. What do you think? Is Pennsylvania kind of out of line there? Well, actually, don't think they're out of line. De-, Devil's advocate possibly, but it, you are trying to avoid paying taxes and whe-, whether or not you agree with that law, i-, you're still circumventing it. You are legal in, in your circumvention of that law. What, what if you're not doing it in order to circumvent the law though? I mean what if you don't even realize that you're subject to paying, uh, income tax on something that you purchase mail order? Really, I, I, don't think that's a valid argument. think that most people are quite aware they're not paying that six percent sales tax. Um, s-, s-, naturally some, some things you just can't find in your local K-Mart or, or, uh, Bryn Mawr stereo dealer. Uh, but th-, th-, th-, then why not pay, pay the sales tax . Corporations have to, why should an individual just because it's, just because the state can't really find out about it, be able to avoid paying sales tax? Well, I mean, it seems to me that, generally, at least in my own experience, when purchase something mail order, it's not to circumvent paying sales tax to the State of Pennsylvania. It's because, I'm sorry, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Yes. Uh, it's because I, can't find the item that want at a competitive price anywhere in my local area. So go outside the area for that. And think that it's not my responsibility to police myself and pay Pennsylvania what they believe they are owed even though, you know, the revenue stream went to another state. don't, don't think that that's my responsibility as a, as a conscientious consumer. I, I'll agree it, it's not your responsibility but, b-, is it also legal,. for you to do that? W-, w-, fr-, from what understand from v-, v-, various net readings, i-, i-, it, the Federal government is going to try to legislate a more aggressive enforcement of state tax schemes, uh, in, into place in the next few years. It is, it is a lost revenue stream right now and states c-, can use all the revenue they can get. With some, with something like that, d-, do your arguments still apply? Well, think that if, if policy is established and if a mechanism is put into place to promote the collection of taxes in this fashion, then don't argue with it."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0035_4372.utt,"Because it's not a burden on the consumer to remember that oh, bought this out of state. need to Xerox the receipt and make out a check for six percent and send it to Pennsylvania. Which is exactly what businesses do at the present. Right. But the point is is that businesses do that. The business that you purchase the thing from is responsible for collecting the appropriate sales tax and forwarding it to the state in question. That's a cost of doing business. The burden … And I, … shouldn't be placed on the consumer. … was actually talking about businesses purchasing something mail order and then having, having to pay sales tax on it. Uh. That's my understanding of the way, uh, the way it works. Usually, the, the person ordering doesn't pay. But the accounting department will, uh, suck up all the bills at the end of the month and realize how much they have to pay. And there r-, there are s-, some substantial, nasty penalties, um, if you, if businesses try to avoid that. Uh, do you mean businesses from the point of view as, of, of selling things to a consumer and … I-,. … then being responsible for the sales tax? No. Businesses, uh … Or purchasing. … if purchasing things mail order, if, if I'm a computer consulting firm and see these, this great deal on forty-six mother boards, uh, from, from say Utah. Um, I, might buy the mother boards from Utah but then still have to pay Pennsylvania sales tax. My a-, accounting department will at the end of the month. think that i-, i-, think that's the way things work in Pennsylvania. And know they work that way in, uh, say here in C. Yeah. See I'm unfamiliar with that because don't, never see that end of the business. Yeah. So, my only experience has been from the point of view of a consumer. Uh, but, if that's the case, if the business is responsible for policing themselves, then think some well defined mechanisms need to be in place so that, uh, the opportunity f-, to forget that you owe sales tax for something, uh, can be avoided. That's true. I-, i-, a r-, a big hole does exist right now, uh, in that consumers can just say oh, I, forgot that. There, there is no well defined mechanism at all and, and that it is a a l-, loss. I, think is that the Federal government will try to establish a mechanism ju-, just to do just that in or-, in order to gain the revenue that's being lost.

Because my husband is a finance major. Uh-huh. And we have, you know, we have money that we take out each month that we, uh, you know, for food and, and for, for gas and things like that. And then we put aside so much money each month for birthdays and for Christmas and for, uh, other things. Uh-huh. Then we take our major purchases we want to make during that year and we budget them into what we call our, our needs and wants list. Uh-huh. And so, uh, the things that, like a vacation. We have a vacation fund. We have a fund for the things we need. And then a, for the things that we want. Uh-huh. And, uh, and we're continually putting into those, you know, each month how much we're going to need and then we know the month that we're going to have enough to get that particular item. Uh-huh. So we very rarely buy anything on credit. Everything we buy is paid for. Yeah. My husband is a finance major also . And, uh, we kind of have the same plan. Uh, we have one credit card and every month we put, uh, you know, the same amount in for retirement. Uh, and we budget, we're, our, our new thing to our budget is we just had a baby. So we're,. budgeting, uh, each month, uh, an allowance for his education … Right. … starting now. Right. So that's in our budget every month now. That's the newest addition. But we too do the same thing as far as, uh, we have a set amount we take, oh, one big vacation a year and then maybe, you know, three small vacations. So we, you know, an,. exact amount that we spend on that each year. Right. And, Uh, we have found that we spend less money if we pull out the money. Uh … Uh-huh. … instead of just writing checks for things. Uh-huh. If we actually pull it out and keep it in a safe here. see. And we actually pull out the money each month that we want to put in for birthdays, that we want to put in for, uh, the vacation. That we put in for Christmas. Like you have a separate account for that then? Well, a lot of that, uh, don't know how safe it is. guess, uh, we keep it all in a safe here at the house. Oh, see. Uh-huh. And so it's actually pulled out. Then we keep our … Oh, see. … we have a savings account for the kids' education. That money goes into there. Uh-huh. Each of our, we have three children. So they each have their own account. see. That money is put into each month. Uh-huh. Does your husband deal in, uh, stocks and bonds and mutual funds and all that kind of stuff?"
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0036_4379.utt,"Th-, does he invest in that and … He does somewhat. … for long-term? Yeah. He does somewhat. Uh-huh. Uh, we have an investment plan. Yeah. guess he does. Uh-huh. But, uh, we have really found, this is the first year we've done it this way. And we are really saving a lot of money. Really. Because you're, you've, you've sat down with a piece of paper and said well let's see what are we going to, so what goes into that, that particular thing?. It's vacations, Christmas. Christmas, birthdays, uh, car maintenance, dental, medical, we just averaged out how much last year we used per month on medical and how much … Uh-huh. … we used on dental and, uh, and so now when we have to come up with that deductible that our insurance doesn't cover … Right. … rather than wondering where it's going to come from, we have it, you know. Uh-huh. And when, when we see something on sale, uh, instead of just looking in our checking account and saying well we've got enough and getting it, and then when something comes up, you know, kind of scrimping to pay for a medical bill. Uh-huh. Everything's taken care of. And we're finding that we even have more money than we thought. Really. Yeah . Well, you know, uh, what do you do as far as, I, take it, do you, uh, run the family budget as far as, uh, groceries and that sort of thing? do. Uh-huh. All the money. Uh-huh. And how, what's that? All the money is turned over to me. Uh-huh. Do you have a set amount that, that you spend each month or … Yes. … or how do you work that? have a set amount. It's very generous and usually have extra. Uh-huh. And so then that can go, uh, you know, either back into our checking account or can just carry it over. Uh-huh. Uh, you know, there are certain months of the year that you'll spend more on food than other months. And … Uh-huh. … certain times when that will be left over. But that's completely up to me how do that. And … Uh-huh. … then, uh, because don't work. stay home. do too. stay home also. And so it's kind of my money and also get my own money to do what want to. Go to lunches, you know, and do that kind of thing. Uh-huh. We have a clothing, uh, envelope for each of the kids and for myself and my husband that we put how much we figure we need each month on clothing. Uh-huh. It really works out great. We're finding that we have a lot more money to spend on things like that. And we're, Yeah. What, what, as far as like big things like something comes up and you have to buy a V or a big item, like for the house."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0036_4379.utt,"How, do you have like a household? Yes. We have a household budget. Like we're going to need to buy a bed for my daughter that's coming out of her crib this year. Uh-huh. And also, we need a new bed. And so we've got both of those budgeted and we put a certain amount in each month and we know which month we'll enough saved to go buy those. Uh-huh."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0037_4382.utt,"Well, here in Logan, Utah, we've got a nice little valley here and it's like crystal clear all the time except for during the winter when the inversion sets in and then we get a little bit of pollution in the valley. Huh. Well, here in Seattle, uh, it's g-, the air's getting more and more polluted. We're, uh, we're in kind of a basin . And, uh, Seattle is on Puget Sound which is a inland waterway between two mountains. And, uh, there's been a lot, a lot of growth, population growth around here . And, uh, it's, uh, it's getting worse . think … Yeah. … most of it is from cars. Yeah. Definitely. Here in Utah up along the Wasatch along the western side of the, of these Rocky Mountains here, where a lot of the big cities are Salt Lake and Ogden and Provo and Logan's up in the valley a little bit further north, we get a lot of pollution and it's like seventy percent of it is from cars. Uh-huh . And, uh, it always really hits hard during the winter when we get the inversion . And when we get,. get cold air down in the valleys and warm air up above and it just sits and sits and sits and we're starting to hit pollution levels now on the Wasatch front which match that of A a few years ago. Oh. It's not, it's almost sad. Because when grew up here, it was just always the crisp air up in the mountain valleys and now it's not in the mountain valleys. Yeah. Yeah, live in the,. university district and, uh, uh, it's supposed to have about the worst air pollution . think probably due to, uh, a lot of students going back and forth to school. Huh. And then we're right next to Interstate Five also. They're getting serious about things like, uh, mandatory, well they've already passed laws where you have to get your cars checked for pollution if you're in certain counties, emissions. Oh, yeah. have they started doing that yet? Yeah. They've actually started doing it down along the, not in Logan up here cause we're doing a lot better. We have a lot, population is a lot lighter up here. We have that here and, uh, they're, they're expanding it to, uh, more counties here. Uh, as the population spreads out and think they're also going to be making it, uh, mandatory for more cars. Th-, th-, there was, uh, something in the law about if you're car was over a certain age, like over twenty years old, you didn't have to get it done anymore. And … Yeah. … think they're eliminating that, uh … Yeah. They're ge-, eliminating that out here. … that loophole. Yeah. They're also talking very seriously about the thing called a dirt gun."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0037_4382.utt,"Where they're, uh, looking at the emissions from the car using basically a spectrometer and looking at the, basically how much of what is coming out of the exhaust. Kind of like a radar gun. And … Oh, really, You mean they could … Yes. … do that remotely? Yeah. Do it remotely just looking at the, what they do, they do several different types of things. Sometimes they put a source light and they look at the source light and then as the car goes by, you can see the exhaust pipe and the source light behind it and you can look at the emissions actually. Huh. And … Now where does the source light go? Like across the street. They'll set up … Oh, see. … like a trap or something like that in some sense. And they're also looking at, uh, other, you know, ways of monitoring this and, cause they've found out something basically that, uh, and a poorly tuned car can emit something, it's an incredible amount. It was like four hundred times as much … Jeez. … uh, of certain pollutants, and it was like unburned hydrocarbons, then a properly tuned car. And, and the idea being that if you just tuned up all the cars, well if you tuned up this ten percent of the cars that were producing like fifty percent of the, the pollution then, you know, you, it'd be one way to cut the pollution in half. Yeah. That's neat . But it's also been, uh, oh, you know, everybody is talking about using more mass transient here but it, uh, it's tough, you know. Like I've, I've looked into riding the bus to work and can drive to work in, uh, and get there in twenty to twenty-five minutes over a very congested corridor. Which goes over Lake Washington on one of the floating bridges. Uh-huh. But if I, uh, if take the bus, it requires several transfers and it takes over an hour. Huh. So so it … Yeah. And they're … it's, it's not hard to see why, why keep driving."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0038_4611.utt,"Hi . Hi. Uh, uh I, should say something. Uh-huh. That I'm the, uh, least informed, this is totally accidental that have to talk about this topic. But, it's, I'm the least informed person in the whole United States. This has not been determined yet but I, I, I've never read a newspaper in my entire life and I've, I, never watch V news nor listen to the news on the radio unless I'm just happening to be listening to music and they slip it on in the car radio before can turn it off. But, Any particular reason?. Well, no. I, I've, I've explored that with lots of people. Uh, they've tried to lock me up and, uh, things like that. But, uh, uh, I'm basically not interested and also find the, uh, everything is so slick and superficial and misguided and mis-, and off the, uh, uh, what am trying to say. Uh,. do learn about things. Uh-huh. Huh . Largely from friends and occasionally will read something like the NEW YORK REVIEW OF BOOKS. You know, someone will write a book about something and then I'll learn all about this thing that was in the news two years earlier. Uh-huh. But it, and somehow, and anything participated in or know about when read about it in the paper is always so, uh, covered from such a funny and superficial perspective that don't have much confidence in it. But, I mean, don't think it's just that I'm lazy . really don't, I, I , like to refer to this as sort of CONSUMER REPORT phenomenon. Uh-huh. Which is everybody that know reads CONSUMER REPORTS so the people who do feel that CONSUMER REPORTS does a wholly inadequate job in their area of particular interest. Uh-huh. But, assume that they do a reasonable job in other areas. Uh-huh. Uh, without thinking that there were people in, who think each other areas, area of, of specialty - and, uh, guess you could explain it two ways. And, and the cynical view is, well these things aren't doing a very good job at all. And the view that would rather take … Uh-huh. … is that there's a different amount of information you need when you're particularly interested in a topic or, uh, particularly interested in buying something as a, you know … Right. … as a hobbyist versus when you want to go out and buy a blender because you need to mix things. Yeah. And think the same thing is true with news. If you want to just have an idea as to what's going on, most papers, a-, and especially the better papers, the, the TIMES, the WALL STREET JOURNAL, the … Uh-huh. … WASHINGTON POST give you a reasonable idea. Yeah. If you were deeply involved in it, then you immediately realize that what they print is stuff that you probably knew already and the stuff that you want they're not printing because the average person doesn't need or want to know …"
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0038_4611.utt,"Right. Doesn't want, … that much. Let me ask, by the way, just for the record. I, I'm, totally concede that intelligent people read these things and intelligent people write them. So, I mean, I'm not being elitist in that sense, hope. Uh, Well, I mean, there's, there's a reasonable question as to whether it's worth the amount of time it takes to keep up on things . Yeah. What, And most people think it is and can, can, you know, accept that some people think it's not and can find better ways to use it. Yeah. By the way when you say most people think it is, think it's like ninety-nine point ninety-nine think it is, percent. don't think it's that high. Oh, you don't? know a lot of people who may watch the V news in the evening but don't spend the time to actually read a newspaper. Right. And think they're saying well if something's really important, I'll at least find out that it happened. Yeah. And, and that's a, that's, is a reasonable start and for awhile didn't read a newspaper when came out here because didn't find one that liked. Uh, and if something important happened, it was covered on V and could then go and, and pick up newspapers if, if it were important enough to read about. Uh-huh. And imagine you get the same level of something that you cared about happened, you'd find out from friends or other channels . Yeah. Uh, did, on the, uh, the Supreme Court hearings, ar-, the, for, uh, uh, the whole business of, uh, see actually have a, a, Clarence Thomas or, Yeah, the Thomas and Anita Hill business. Right. I, mean that's, that's the closest thing. deeply cared about that. Uh-huh. Uh, and sort of had planned to have dinner with a friend of mine and when arrived at her house, she was engrossed in that. We ended up watching it for a couple of hours. Zooming out and grabbing something to eat and then zooming back and ea-, watching it some more. And thought that was terrific because she actually helped me understand what was going on. But even then, didn't end up doing it on my own. Uh, uh, Yeah. stayed as far away from those as could. Uh-huh. decided didn't want to waste the time had, guess, five years ago now, wasted that kind of time with Oliver North hearings. Right, right. Yeah. And afterwards, decided that what had gotten out of it just wasn't worth the time put in. Uh-huh. And that these things are just very slow in seeing information … Yeah. … come out."

Yes sir. work for the research facility. Uh, and it's, it's kind of small in a sense but it, it does have, about, uh, guess, two thousand civil employees. Uh-huh. And, on a, a scale, guess it's still considered small. It just have a lot of different laboratories. Uh-huh. The area work in, it, it primarily have maybe a hundred people or so. Uh-huh. So that's make up most of the laboratory so from, from that standpoint, it's pretty small … Uh-huh. … it's pretty small. What about yourself? Huh. Well, I, work for, uh, actually probably similar kind of place. work for, uh, Lincoln Laboratory. Oh, okay. Uh, yeah. We actually do some work with some people down at Georgia Tech. Oh, okay. see. Uh, and, uh, so we're, we're part, we're actually part of I T. So it's very much the same kind of place and, uh … Oh, okay. … the technical institution. Right. Uh, Uh, while was sitting here waiting while they tried to find somebody for me to talk to, trying to think of what, uh, uh, what things were important, uh, besides salary and a, and a job. guess, uh, list had scribbled down was the people you worked with and maybe the, uh, the challenge of the work and, uh … Uh-huh. … the working conditions, things like that. Right. don't know. What are your, uh, what sorts of things would you consider important? Well those and probably the security aspect of it. Uh-huh. Because a lot of time nowadays, even though you're working, uh, you're treated, and it may not be true in every place. In a lot of cases think you're treated more like a number instead of a, a person. Uh-huh. Because when it come down to layoff, they don't really consider people and, and, you know, their well being as far as, you know, how they going, their next dollar going to come in. How they going to pay their bills. They just lay them off. Yeah. And was reading this book one time about this guy that had, uh, think the company still exists. What they use to do is, they used to cut the number of hours for everybody as opposed to just laying people off … Uh-huh. … you know. That way that, you know, one person wouldn't get one big blunt blow at one time. Uh-huh. And, uh, you know, think if they had programs that set up to subsidize people that do get laid off a little bit better, you know, other than s-, you know, something like, unemployment is good but I mean the company as a whole - because you as an employee, even the company is making money, they paying you a salary but you are responsible for that company growth."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0039_4628.utt,"You're responsible also for helping that company get to the par-, point that it's at at making profits. So there should be something in there or some kind of clause that will subsidize people if they did lose their job other than, you know, uh, neglect or something like that. Uh-huh. You know. Because it's not a person's fault that, you know, people not buying or businesses are, are not on the up and up all the time, you know. don't see how one or two people, maybe more one or two, but, you know, a number of people can, can be the downfall of com-, a company situation. Now how do you mean that? know it, Well in a sense that say, how do you make a, a conclusion that you're going to lay off these ten people. Uh-huh. Uh, for the bad times of the company. What about the, the work effort those ten people did when the company was doing well. Uh-huh. You know. In that standpoint. Well, you, you think it's better than to, to try to spread the, the effort equally among all the employees of the company or, Ye-, yes, do. Uh-huh. really do. think it'd be better that way and even at that, it would at least give the person time to look for another job because … Uh-huh. … they know that that there are problems and, you know, there are reason to look for another job … Yeah. … instead of just dumping it on them all at one time. Uh-huh. You know. That's just, that's my views, you know. Yeah. I've heard of a couple of companies that have done that. think, uh, back about, a few years ago when things were tough, Hewlett-Packard did that for awhile. They went to a, uh, a, a four and a half day work week rather … Right. … than cut, yeah, just cut everybody back ten percent. Right. And, uh, have to, give everybody a half day a week off. Right. And think you can do that for a little while but I'm, Well at least that would give a person a chance to look … Yeah. … you know. Because the way it is, a person really don't have a chance ."

Uh, but, uh, I've, I've noticed that, uh, this year it seems to have been a lot warmer than it has in the past. Yeah, it, it, it's, it's a lot warmer, a lot drier too, because usually about this time of year, this, you know, you see a little bit more rain. I mean by, by mid February, I mean, we start getting a lot of rain. Yeah, yeah, well remember last year, or the year before, But it, uh, we had ice and snow, uh, uh, terrible ice storm, uh, around this time of the year. Uh-huh. And, uh, this year it's been so hot and, uh, sunny it, it's really quite, uh, quite amazing. Yeah, unseasonable. used to, my wife and we used to live in San Antonio, couple years ago, Uh-huh. and it was, it was remember the first day of Spring, it was so much ice that came down, later on that afte-, that afternoon and evening, Um. it was just, it was horrible. Yes, was just talking to my son today, he's up in Boston,. and it was twenty-nine there and it was, you know, in the seventies out here and, Yeah. it was really, uh, he really wished he could be here, rather than there. Yeah, well, um, don't know I, guess I'm just sort of acclimated to colder weather. Oh really. Um, I, like it warmer, I mean like it, you know, like it warm but it doesn't really matter. I mean, I'd, would much rather see it cool at this time of year anyway because it would mean a little bit more rain possibly but, uh, Uh-huh, uh-huh. have, you know, I, I, don-, think it's really been delightful. come, uh, I've spent most of my time in, in warm weather areas and, uh, uh, the ice and snow just doesn't, uh, hold any allure for me at all. Well spent three years in Germany, so I'm not too thrilled with the whole thing anyway . But got used to it, it was really strange, I mean, when I, when, when, when we came to San Antonio it was just like, uh, you know, it just, just swelter and then we got used to it and then we went up to Dallas and it was just, it's, it's not, not that it's just hot or dry, it's just not very comfortable, it just, Her-, do you, you think San Antonio is more comfortable than Dallas. Yeah, a little bit. Uh-huh. Yeah. You must, well, uh, it must be quite a bit hotter down there, isn't it? Yeah, my wife and I, the last day we were in Florida, we, my visiting my, uh, my parents, and my brother and sister, we were, we were down there and, the last day, right before we left, we had to, had to ride with my sister and the air conditioning went out on the car , Oh, wow."

Oh yeah, it's terrible. Orlando is the only place I've ever been where I've seen the car sweat. Yeah. I mean, that's really bad. Yeah, well, I mean, I, I, guess I've been in some places, you know, where the weather was just so mild, you know, places like Monterey, California or, Uh-huh, uh-huh. you know, just, you know, so mild, and then you've been to such extremes like San Angelo, Texas where you just, where you walk outside and you sweat, you know you're sweating, Yeah. you look down at your arm, but you see the water leaving your arm, it's so hot, Oh wow, uh. you just feel it pulling away, bizarre. know I, tend to, tend to be able to get along with monotony in the weather when it's very temperate. Yeah. Uh it doesn't, some people say, uh, they, they like to watch the changing of the seasons but, uh, I'd rather, you know, like southern California, you know, have it kind of sunny and temperate all the time. Yeah. So, it's kind of a luxury. tend to agree but, don't know, I, think, in, in some, in some respects it probably more tolerable. Yeah, well guess this, the weather isn't as lively a topic as, uh, as some of the others we might have gotten. No, the other topics. got one topic, they said talk about the Middle East situ-, well, guess we're supposed to say good-bye or something, and think about what - my daughter is here prodding me to say good-bye. We messed up the conversation, anyway. Well I mean I've had some pretty bad, guess some pretty controversial topics so it's just like well that was my fault. But then the weather's like, man, I mean, it gets pretty mundane, I mean you can only talk about, about the situation just so long. Yeah, know, weather's just not all that inspiring.

Yeah, we have random drug testing at, in my business, but I've never been, uh, never had to do it. Oh, really? Yeah, yeah, they started that about a year ago, and think it's mostly for the, the field people that, you know, drive trucks and heavy machinery, that kind of stuff. Uh-huh. But, uh, they, they have done some testing around our office, mostly after lunch, looking for people drinking, uh, drinking beer and stuff at lunch time, at least that's. Oh, they do with alcohol. Pardon? They do it with alcohol? Yeah, yeah, they, they, they'll check for alcohol. Oh, thought it was just like marijuana or cocaine. No, once, once you start doing that stuff, you sort of, you're sort of stuck into, uh, checking for the whole, the whole thing. Huh. That's interesting. Yeah, it's a, What type of field of work are you in? I'm in the oil business. Oh, in the oil business. Yeah. Okay, and you work in the office around. Yeah, work in the office, so, uh, it's pretty, pretty safe environment. Uh-huh. Yeah see, work in the automotive air bag industry, where we make the safety bags … Uh-huh, uh-huh. … for the cars, and we work around a lot of explosives. Well, that sounds like kind of an important job to be, uh, straight on. Yeah, so that's, you know, I'm all for it, because the, well, the type of environment work in, you know, they're working with explosives, and so they could blow up the whole, well, they have safety features with each of the explosives they use, but still, it can be dangerous. Yeah, yeah, well, I, I, agree. think that, uh, you know, under certain circumstances, especially when you're working in, in high risk, uh, uh, industries, where you can really hurt other people, that, that you need to have that kind of stuff. Yeah. You know, if it's, as long as it's not abused, uh, you know, random, you know, as long as it's random, and, and the individual's rights are, uh, are protected, don't have that big a problem with it. Now do they fire them, or do they? Well, see, this is it, this is where start having my problems with my company. work for a private company, and … Uh-huh. … and the policy is something like, see if can re-, state this correctly now. If you turn yourself in as having a drug related problem, then you're eligible for company counseling."

So, it, you know, it's sort of one of these little catch twenty-twos. Huh, that's. think our policy is that, all right, it's probably the same thing. I'm not really sure what the , Yeah, really, it's one of those things that you read once, and then, if you, if you're not worried about it, you just forget about it . That's right. But know, they do have counseling, and that they do give you a second chance, but I'm not sure if … Yeah. … if it's if you get caught or if you turn yourself in. Yeah, yeah, our company's a little tougher on the second chance. I mean, if, if they're going to give you the opportunity to turn yourself in, then they ought to, you know, go out of the way, think, a little bit more to, uh, to help you get, help get you rehabilitated to, you know, to get get back at your job. Uh-huh. But, uh, when you're not, when you're a private company, the rules don't always apply. Uh, do you think it works very good with that random, do you think it limits, Well, it's, it's hard for me to, to evaluate it because everybody work around is in an office environment and, you know, it's not, guess ha-, haven't run into anybody that's, that's had a problem that's, that's been a problem. Uh-huh. Uh, so gue-, you know, guess it works, uh, much like, uh, well, shoot, like any lottery, I mean, everybody's got an equal chance to get picked. Uh-huh. So, uh, I'd rather have that than, you know, say well, this week the -s and -s are going to be in and next week,. s and -s are going to come in . You could time it just right. Yeah, right, right. know one employee, know, when was working with, he had alcohol on his breath, and I'm not sure if our policy covers that or not. That'd be just as dangerous. Yeah. Well, especially around, uh, you know, equipment, machinery and stuff. Huh. That's true. You know, I've, I've gone out and had a, had a beer at lunch time, but not to excess in any case . Uh-huh. Do they give any limits on alcohol, or is it? Uh, don't remember, to tell you the truth. don't think they do. Um, well, they must, I mean, gee whiz. That just shows you how much I've been paying attention, because I, really don't know. I'll have to go into work tomorrow and ask . Oh. Well, you know, you can take some of that, that testing a little bit too far. Uh, there was a company in Houston that, they did, uh, an unannounced drug sweep of the, of their company …"
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0041_4048.utt,Uh-huh. …
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0042_4060.utt,"Okay Karen. You-, you're first. Okay. was just going to say think one of the biggest thing for me is room for advancement. You know, not to get in, like in a dead end job. Uh-huh. And plus, for me, it's, uh, I mean like medical and you know, uh, benefits and dental. Okay. They're also important. Yeah. guess one of the differences see is, uh, working for a university, uh, there is room for advancement, but not so much so, our in, uh, quite a highly unionized environment … Um. … and then also in the administrative association so there is a progressive path, but not being in the say the commercial sector, the motivation isn't there for a lot of people … Um. … uh, like really, Are they like pretty much train for a specific job and that what hired for and then I, just very little variation from that. Yeah, somewhat that, but then also there just isn't the ability to in one sense have, uh, a broader scope for rewarding people for their performances. Uh-huh. Uh, so that's in our situation where we are dealing with an institution, uh, it's a little more difficult to recognize an individual's performance … Uh-huh. … and suppose that's maybe a disadvantage of being in a larger institution, perhaps somewhat even with the business, uh. But agree, you know, the, uh, medical benefits and those kinds of things are one of the big pluses of working for a large organization and also the, uh, security aspect for long term employment, uh, Well, you know that's interesting though. Because don't know if that's necessarily the case anymore. use to think that, you know, after you work, you mean security, job security? Job security, yes. Uh, that use to be think a couple of years ago, but don't know if it is so much anymore. In fact, they, we just had a lay off in what November, guess. Uh-huh. But, uh, it wasn't necessarily, I mean, you know, some people had been there a long time. Yeah, we are seeing that here as well. Like in some of the large oil companies. There has been massive lay offs. Uh-huh. Uh, so I, think there it's probably a major distinction between institutions and the corporate world … Uh-huh. … in, uh, institutions are slower to react both on the growth side and then also on the reduction side where the businesses, we need to cut back, that's what we do. Uh-huh. No doubt … But, … yeah. Yeah, and institutionally, like here at the university, oh if there is a cut back, well gee, it's not where it necessarily where it's needed, it's where it's most expedient which, Expedient, yeah that's exactly it."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0042_4060.utt,"Yeah, where the most dollar, where, where you know it cuts back the most. Well, in one sense for us, it's where it makes the least noise which means it's … Oh. … often the lowest support type roles. Oh. See, yeah. So we, Yeah. think that's one of the things too. You get too many management people, you know. It's very easy. Yeah and it's very easy for them to say, oh this is the best way when they really aren't aware of what all it took to get the work done you know. Yeah. And then they wonder why it doesn't get done in the same amount of time. Well, those people aren't there anymore. Right. Because it's support people that are providing … Yeah. … the speed for it. Uh-huh. Yeah, but, so what else do you think is important? Well the, uh, that's maybe the majority of the importance, guess. Yeah, because my perspective is from an institution, uh, the, there is not much incentive for innovativeness … Uh-huh. … because the limitation for reward is very severe … Uh-huh. … but if you're in the corporate world, think there is considerable motivation for guess in-, innovation, although he, you know, the more complex your structure the, uh, less difficult it is to kind of carry some things through … Uh-huh. … but, uh, think there is, uh, it's a long term type of process where in a small organization it's, uh, things can happen much more quickly and so you can see the reward of the efforts. think probably in a small, yeah, was going to say more, it's more personal for one thing. You probably have a better team, uh, cooperation, or team playing, atmosphere. Right. Probably, where as in a bigger corporation, think you're just a number, you know. Yeah. You end up being your own person … Uh-huh. … and, uh, if you do your job fine and if somebody else is messing it up, well then that's their problem and … Uh-huh. … you know you really, whereas yeah in a smaller, think you would be more willing to either help that person or help it get accomplished, you know. Yeah. Yeah. It becomes the organization instead of person being you know a part of the individual themselves. Uh-huh."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0043_4148.utt,"Hi. Okay. So, uh, with the issue of trial by jury, uh, actually found the whole question about whether you need a, a unan-, a unanimous verdict in a criminal case to be somewhat interesting. Yeah, actually, I, agree that that's an interesting thing. I, believe that's a, for, for civil suits it's not unanimous, right, but for, for criminal suits it's unanimous by federal law? don't know if it's even true that it's always unanimous because thought there were cases where, uh, I don't know if it's the difference between felonies and misdemeanors, but where it was okay for a state to have it like eleven out of twelve. Yeah, actually thought I'd read that, too and that's why phrased it that way. Yeah. wonder, the difference, yeah, the difference could be that for, uh, state, if there is such a thing, state felonies versus federal felonies that federal, things that are under federal jurisdiction require the unanimous vote, and things that are under state jurisdiction, even criminal don't require, but don't know what the, the laws, do you think that that's an unreasonable, uh, requirement that they be unanimous? Well, I'd be curious as to what the, uh, requirement for a, an acquittal is. And I, don't think it would be wrong to say that eleven out of twelve can convict if there were something corresponding saying that if, you know, six or seven voted not guilty, then instead of it being a hung jury, that was an acquittal. But don't know whether you need an, a unanimous, uh, vote of not guilty to acquit. Yeah, that, that would be an interesting change. It was also allow the, uh, idea that if you had one person who was, uh, very disagreeable that, I mean, it, it fundamentally changes the way the processing occurs because, uh, the fact that it's w-, the, the principle is that the fact that it's unanimous insures the beyond a reasonable doubt, uh, criterion that it, uh, increases the, the likelihood of getting the proper judgment. So, I, think, if anything, it would have to be a very close to unanimous decision. Yeah, I'd agree with that. But I've never had the, the opportunity to serve on a jury, although I've been out here and registered for, guess, about five years. Yeah, actually … But, … I, thought that that would be very interesting thing to do. would like to do that. I've been out here twenty some years and I've been called, uh, three different times, but I've never actually even made it into the, the jury box. Oh. And, because there have always been a number of people and, and I've never gotten up there to answer any of the questions."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0043_4148.utt,"Uh, I, yeah, also think that would be really good. I, Well , the people know who have served have said that usually what ends up happening is that, you know, after initially finding out where people stand, that the whole deliberation usually results, if there is a, you know, something like a nine, three or, or more severe and, and the people in the majority trying to convince the minority that they're right … Uh-huh. … and in fact, I'm not sure that that's any more, uh, liable to get rid of the reasonable doubt than, than anything else. Well, the, the one thing that know does seem to happen from people I've talked to on this, is that in the situation you just said where it's nine to three, or some such number, that there's, an effect starts being that there's starts being a lot of peer pressure … Uh-huh. … going on and that that, uh, peer pressure, and in some cases if it's a long trial, the desire of people to get out of there and not be stuck in there for a very long time, that people are changing their minds for the wrong reasons. Yeah, I'd … Uh, … read one book, I think it was calls TRIAL BY JURY of all things, that, uh … Uh-huh. … went through and interviewed a bunch of jurors in some of the big cases, and in many cases looking at what had, at the evidence afterwards as to whether the decision was right, went back to the jurors, uh, based on the deliberations. Some of them did say that, you know, when they were the only one left opposing the verdict, uh, you know, everyone was getting on them so, so heavily that eventually they just gave in knowing that nothing they could do could stop it from either being the verdict everyone else was trying for or a hung jury because the one vote doesn't mean anything except the ability to not have a verdict. Yeah, I, understand. You, you would hope that if you were in that situation that you'd have the moral fortitude, uh, to hold out if you believed that that was really the proper response. think of the movie, uh, TWELVE ANGRY MEN. Uh-huh. You ever seen that movie? Yeah, once."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0044_4177.utt,"Hi. So, do you think you get good coverage from the sources that you have? Uh, actually no, because, because I'm in school. I, kind of miss out on most of the current events. just catch the major ones off the news or if someone starts to talk about it. Do you watch a lot of V to get the news then? Uh, don't watch a lot of it, but that's the on-, basically that's my only major source of information. Um. What about, what about you? Well, read, uh, get a bunch of different things. get a newspaper every day and try to at, at least have a few minutes to look through that and look through, uh, get a NEWSWEEK every week which I, pretty much read that cover to cover and I, as far as, you know, that satisfies most of the short term news get. Uh, don't watch much V, don't have enough time and, uh, don't listen to the radio too much especially the news channels or anything like that, you know, they might give you a little blurbs like … Yeah. … this happened or that happened and that's about all ever hear of it. Uh, but most of my news probably comes from NEWSWEEK and for the longer term I, read, uh, like SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN and, and, uh, READERS' DIGEST and some of those other types of magazines that come out which, they, the news isn't, like, immediate what you'd generally think of as news, but it's recent material. And it's more in depth. Yeah, it is, it is more in depth, less broad. Well, actually, it's, probably isn't less broad, but it's just more in depth and, uh, it is, it is more sig-, it is more just significant information, you know. It is the big events, not the little events. Yeah. Not the fact that there was a big auto accident down on the corner of Broad and Main, you know. know, where they're just trying to fill in. Yes, or they're making, making time because they to fill in an hour's worth of news. Yeah. Uh, get kind of bored watching V actually, when watch the news on V because … know, do, do, too. … it goes so slow and, then there's nothing that, you know, really is like oh, so exciting. Yeah, you may find one little, uh, news item interesting so you have to wait twenty minutes to, to hear about it. Yeah, that, that's about what it ends up being. Listen to the news to hear the traffic report or something . Yeah, actually, y-, you mention NEWSWEEK, I, I, do like, uh, S NEWS AND WORLD REPORT. don't get to read it as much as like, but that's, think that's a good magazine. Yeah, think they're about the same. I, you know, they, they certainly have a very similar, uh, charter at least in my mind."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0044_4177.utt,"And, uh, uh, what, what kind of, uh, what kind of news normally interests you, I mean what do you, what, what do you find interesting … Well … versus what do you find boring? … right now trying to keep abreast of, uh, what's going on in Europe, you know, with all the, S R's satellites breaking off, trying to become independent and, you know, European community coming together. Uh-huh. That's going to affect our, uh, economy quite a bit. think it will, uh, they, they keep claiming it's going to have a big influence, but we've yet to see it and th-, it's real short term yet, though, I mean, it's only been, three months or something like that … Oh, yeah. … since that happened so, Yeah. But they like to tell us that it's going to be important . I'm, I'm pretty sure it is, because, uh … think it is, too. … once, once Europe becomes unified and, uh, their economy becomes one big economy we're going to be, uh, kind of hurting . Yeah, I, think that's a possibility, uh, it, we might also be helped, though, because it, it will be easier to do business over there, too. Yeah, definitely. For the companies that already have a presence over there and, uh, know of at least one company that specifically went over there and established a presence before nineteen ninety-two so that they would have it when it … Oh, yeah … came time. … so they have a toe hold, good toe hold. Yep. Because once you're in there, then you can easily expand. But getting in after nineteen ninety-two is more difficult. Yeah, because, when they first start off, they're going to be highly protectionist so, Yes. Yeah. And there's already a lot of evidence that they are being very protectionist, even amongst themselves, they're being somewhat protectionist, you know. Yeah. Like, England doesn't want to do one thing and, and Sweden doesn't want to do other thing and they're, they've all got their own reasons which have to be resolved yet. Uh-huh. And some of it, I mean, is, I'm sure within those people's minds, it's quite justified. Yeah, I, can understand their viewpoint, they're just, they're starting off, their economy's a little bit weak, so you want to … Uh-huh. … get established before they … Before they … com-, … open up their borders to everyone. Yeah, totally. Uh, what is the, uh, do you watch anything like with sports or anything like that? Actually I'm not really into sports. My roommates are, so, unfortunately, forced to watch quite a bit of sports. Against your will. Yeah, we have to, fight over the remote control."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0044_4177.utt,"Yeah, at least you guys have a remote control. It's sometimes better to not have one of those. Course, you can always mislocate it."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0045_4312.utt,"So, what kind of music you into? Well, have a, uh, pretty wide taste, uh, in music, ranging from progressive rock to jazz to, uh, lot of different forms of, uh, music. In fact, it's easier for me to say, uh, the types of music that don't like are opera and, uh, screaming heavy metal. The opera, yeah, it's right on track. like classical, but can't deal with opera at all. And heavy metal, uh, it's noisy. I'm into, uh, some industrial music that's, a, a bit even harder than that. Uh-huh. But it's, it's got to have a point to it. Oh, don't mind music that's difficult to listen to,. but, uh, the, the, uh, basic point of heavy metal w-, which seems to be music to annoy you,. is, uh, gets a little annoying. Yeah. What kind of progressive stuff? Uh, lot of stuff that actually has, uh, ended up becoming popular like, uh, Nirvana and, uh, oh, you know, I'm thirty, so lot of the stuff was listening to in my teens like the Clash and, and the Sex Pistols and … uh. … E M, that sort of stuff. Uh, E makes me laugh because they've gone from a college radio progressive group to being, uh, you know, ultra mainstream at this point, and it's not really that they've changed their musical style so much as the stream changed. Oh, yeah. Yeah, it's, a lot of people l-, like, saying that, you know, bands in that position, you know, sold out. Uh-huh. think that's pretty much, you know, bull. Because E really hasn't changed. If, it's, it's interesting. They're producing, uh, similar music and it's good music … Uh-huh. … but, you know, people have picked up on it. That's good. think it is. I'm impressed. Uh, for a while there, music seemed to really ha-, popular music seemed to have, uh, not a lot of point to it. was really tired of, uh, the Michael Bolton. Mi-, Michael Bolton really got on my nerves because he,. he was making all this money doing mediocre cover tunes. Oh, yeah. And could, uh, go down to a bar that's about three minutes from my house and hear people doing covers better than him not making nearly as much money. Uh, but he picked the right songs and … guess. … and that , that's about all he had going for him. Or still has, for that matter. That, and a marvelous hairdo. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I'm sure that, that so-, that sold a lot for him. That's all you really need for a lot of, lot of pop. I'm ki-, I've kind of like developed a, a short hatred for, for pop. It just seems like there's no, no real point. You hear the same, same tune over and over again … Uh-huh. … in a thousand guises and, Well, i-, it's interesting because you were, you were saying that you liked classical music …"
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0045_4312.utt,"Uh-huh. … and like a lot of classical music, but also dislike, uh, some classical music, and what gets me even more is the attitude of people who are really into classical music,. and feel that if, if it's not seventy five years old, it hasn't stood the test of time. Yeah, can, can believe that. What kind of things are you, do you like in classical? What's the … Uh, … standard? Stuff that like, uh, like Bach. tolerate Vivaldi. can't,. stand, uh, uh, Debussy or Debussy . Uh, uh, like Tchaikovsky. He can make a lot of noise when he's, uh, so inclined. Oh, yes. Uh, and some of, some stuff that like, uh, for instance, Frank Zappa has done a fair amount of orchestral composition … Uh-huh. … and that's interesting music,. but it would not get performed by any, uh, municipally funded, uh, philharmonic,. uh, just because, number one, it's Frank Zappa and he's weird, number two, isn't he still alive. You know, we're, we're,. much better off playing, uh, Beethoven's ninth, that's right, you know, w-, we'll do, we'll do the ninth and everyone will know it and … It's safe. … and hum it and i-, it, it just isn't chance taking enough for me."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0046_4316.utt,"Do you think that there's any way that, uh, or do you think there's too much crime now? I mean, guess,. any crime is too much but, Uh, yeah, yeah. It's out of control. Uh, well, uh, out of control, don't know. guess it could be worse. Uh, we've, uh, we've, we've got quite a bit of crime in our neighborhood. Uh, live in the university district in Seattle near the University of Washington. Uh, there's, uh, there's a lot of problems. I mean, there's like a big rise in homelessness and more street people and, uh, you know, we get c-, cars on our block, uh, regularly, uh, uh, g-, uh, gone through, rifled through and stuff. Really? Yeah. would not of, okay, would not have guessed that in Seattle. Yeah, you figured it was like Omaha, right? Yeah. You know. No, it's, uh, it's not Newark, but, uh, yeah it's got problems. Yeah, wonder, I mean, wonder what, what really is the answer. I mean, it seems like our, our, the prison systems, we can't seem to decide whether or not it's a reform system or penal system. Yeah, think most people regard it as a warehouse. Yeah. Where you put away the people that are so bad that, uh, you don't want them out in circulation. But, but the problem is, is that we, we only have but so much room and we, we try to put aside in the warehouse, and all we do is just displace other people which come back into society and … Yeah. … commit crimes and, That's what hear. So it's, uh, Yeah, I, think, you know, don't you feel like most people have given up on the rehabilitation idea? get the feeling that a lot of people have. I'm not convinced that have. Yeah. Uh, see, I mean, my mom taught English as a second language and, and she was dealing mostly with people that were, were in on drug crimes and, uh, Oh, you mean she taught in a prison? Yes. Oh. In a … see. … in a maximum security prison down in central Virginia. uh. And, the problem she had was not with the inmates at all. The, the people that she had the most problems with were the people that ran the prison. I mean, Yeah, the b-, the bureaucracy. It was, it was, I mean, they, they put her, I mean, didn't, obviously didn't see the classroom, uh, and, hopefully never will, but, uh … . … they, they put her at the end of a hallway, there were no other classes going on at the time and they refused to let her wear a body al-, a body alarm. Uh. Which, and - don't know exactly what that is, but just assume it was something that she could hit immediately and, and really annoy a lot of people. Yeah. But, uh, you know , So she didn't feel safe."
/home/nxingyu/data/utt/sw00utt/sw_0046_4316.utt,"No, she didn't. She didn't, she, she felt fine for the first year when she had her first set of inmates, and then later on the, uh, the administration kept getting worse, and, uh, she got a couple of inmates that she wasn't, she didn't feel quite as comfortable around. Yeah. But, well, she had decided that it was, when we came back to the States, she decided that it was too, she didn't feel that public schools were s-, were safe, so next thing you know she's teaching in a maximum security prison. Yeah, right. But, uh, Well, at least it's maximum security, right . Yeah. But, but the point that was, that it, you know, you said that perhaps, uh, people have given up the thought that rehabilitation's possible and, and I'm, I'm thinking that it's even to the point that the people in, that run the system have given up on it. Uh, well, I, think the people that run, yeah, that run the system are the most hardened and probably the most cynical, you know. Uh. I mean, I, uh, you know, I, talked to a few people who worked in prisons and stuff and it's, uh, you can get pretty hardened, I'm sure. But getting, I mean, well, see, always have problems because, because can never decide whether or not I'm, I'm supposed to be a conservative or, or a liberal but, Yeah, right. But keep, Those are funny labels, see . keep thinking that there's got to be some way, that, that a lot of this is circumstances. I mean, can't help but wonder if, if grew up without a father, on the streets, and … Oh, yeah. … with like little or no money, wouldn't … Oh, … wouldn't be in prison at this point ? Oh, yeah, absolutely. think, uh, yeah, think you can blame it on social problems. Sure. I mean, don't know. I mean, as, as, you know, as poverty has gotten worse, as, you know, education has gotten worse, as there's been more single parent families, as there's been more homelessness, there's m-, been more crime. We've got methadone programs where people who desperately want to get off drugs can't … Yeah, there's not enough … get onto the program. … beds and treatment programs, rising drug abuse, and, yep, it's a mess. don't, don't remember the, the gentleman's name, but the, the, uh, the mayor of Baltimore is a, is a Rhodes Scholar and what he, Is he the guy wants to, like, deregulate heroin, or something? Well, what he wants to do is take all the money that, uh, he gets for drug enforcement and use it for, uh, drug education. Uh-huh. And basically, just, just attack the problem at the demand side.
