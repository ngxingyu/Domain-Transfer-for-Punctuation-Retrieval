       "'(Police radio chatter) (Radio chatter continues, indistinct conversations) (Exhales) (Indistinct conversations) (Shutter clicking) Hey, Jane. Got a positive I.D. on the victim. Viktor Mendelssohn. 62. He was a diamond cutter. He has a shop in the San Francisco Diamond district. Same as it ever was-- more bodies, more death. Not exactly the same. This one was eviscerated with an electric rotary saw. Huh. Excuse me. Your toe. Careful. Sorry. Is it me, or does Jane seem a little bit off since the feds took Lorelei? Well, he spent six months setting a trap for Red John. He has nothing to show for it. How would you feel? Maybe we should invite him out for a night with the boys. (Sighs) All right, you ask him. (Clicks, flame whooshes) Well, I-I came out this morning to snip my herbs. It\\'s always best to do that right after the morning dew evaporates. (Voice breaking) And when I didn\\'t see Viktor, I got a really bad feeling. Do you usually see him in the morning? Every morning. We chat over the fence. Hey. Jane, this is Betty Fulford. Hey. She lives next door. Patrick Jane. So did Viktor tell you about anybody who might want to hurt him? No! Although... last night when I was getting ready for bed, I did hear him arguing with a man in his house. What were they arguing about? Flowers. Really? Blue orchids, to be exact. They--they were shouting, and Viktor never shouts. And you were in your bedroom at this time? That\\'s right. That\\'s right. My window was open. Did you happen to catch a glimpse of the other man? Well, I tried to snoop, but I couldn\\'t see into the kitchen. That\\'s where they were having it out. (Teapot whistling) What\\'s that noise? I have absolutely no idea, but I will investigate. (Continues whistling) (Whistling stops) (Mutters indistinctly) Mm. (Clatters) (Rattles) (Rattles) (Rattles) (Rattles) (Rattles) (Rattles) (Slams lid) (Teacup shatters) Everything okay in there? (Patrick) Everything\\'s fine! It\\'s all peachy. (Rattles) What are you doing in there? (Giggles) ♪ The Mentalist 5x02 ♪ Devil\\'s Cherry Original Air Date on October 7, 2012 == sync, corrected by elderman == Ohh. Rabbit stew. Yummy. We need to fatten you up. Hello. Hmm? What time did you get to the house this morning? Same time every Monday. 8:30. I walk from the bus stop. Do you have a key to the house? No. Mr. Mendelssohn let me in. But this morning, he didn\\'t answer the door, so I looked in the window. Well, you did the right thing. Calling the police-- very brave. Very brave. I told Mr. Mendelssohn something bad was coming, but he didn\\'t listen to me. Why did you think something bad was on its way? The black ants. For two weeks I come now, and I clean black ants from the house. Black ants? In some South American countries it\\'s said that if black ants enter your house, then someone in your family might die. Ay. Gracias a dios. You understand. Si. Si. This is... an eagle\\'s claw. It will help you find who did this. Oh. Take it, please. Okay. Thank you. I will. I\\'ll just-- no te olvides. Okay. Thank you. Ooh. Oops. Excuse me. (Police radio chatter) Bunny? Where\\'s the bunny? Here. Rigsby, hold this. Has anyone seen a rabbit around here? Excuse me. Uh, did you happen to see a rabbit? Ja. Thank you. (Door creaks) Hello, fella. Yeah? There... Ahh, there you are. Huh? Gotcha. Fella. You found him. I take it this belongs to you. Yeah. It\\'s the third time he\\'s escaped. Chews through that metal like a floppy-eared rat. Thanks for finding him. Oh. Pleasure. Certainly took your time getting here. You were expecting me? Yeah, of course. You know something about the murder? Yeah. Poor old Mr. Mendelssohn. You know anything that could help us? You tell me. How can I know what you know? How can I know what I know will help you? You\\'re testing me. Why? You don\\'t have issues with authority figures. You know you\\'re the smartest person in most rooms. What\\'s your name? Am I required to tell you? Well, I\\'m just a consultant. You don\\'t have to tell me anything. Then I won\\'t. Okay. Have it your way. - Wait. Where are you going? - Well, you\\'re playing me. You don\\'t have anything helpful to offer me. Stop. Who\\'s playing who? (Scoffs) You think you can manipulate me with reverse psychology? Seems to be working. Well, it\\'s not. (Clicks tongue) I\\'ll help you. But not because of your lame attempt to prey on my ego. I\\'m bored. Not a whole lot\\'s going on in my world. And what world\\'s that? Come on. (Sets parking brake) Mr. Mendelssohn hardly went to his store in the diamond district. He, um... liked to work close to home here. This is his workshop. Have you been inside before? No. But I\\'ve seen him go in a lot. He spent all of his time here. (Girl) Wow. (Sighs) This place is so cool. Heh. Weird... is what it is. (Chuckles) It\\'s like a place in a dream. Close, but no cigar. You\\'re getting warmer, though. What? Who are you? What\\'s your name? Here we go again with the name. You have a definite tendency to obsess. Do people ever tell you that? All the time. What are you hiding? You tell me. You\\'re the mentalist. I never said I was a mentalist. Spooky. So how did I know? You\\'re playing a little game with me. I want to know why. Who are you? What\\'s your name? Charlotte. Okay. Well, that\\'s half a name. It\\'s a start. Half a nice name. I had a daughter named Charlotte. I know. No. No, you don\\'t. Who put you up to this? Red John? Red John, Red John, Red John. I am so over Red John. You\\'re not my daughter. My daughter was murdered. I found her body. (Gasps softly) \"You are safe, you are loved, and you are wise\"\" who told you those words? (Voice breaking) You did. Every night when you tucked me into bed. Hey, Jane. How\\'d you find this place before we did? Lisbon, good. Uh, could you run a background check on this girl? (Chuckles) She\\'s playing a con on me--a very good one. And who are you, miss? Hello. I\\'m his daughter-- Charlotte. I\\'ve heard so much about you. It\\'s nice to meet you. My daughter\\'s dead! - He\\'s having another episode. - Yeah. Come on, buddy. Why don\\'t you have a seat? What is wrong with you? It\\'s all right. We\\'ll explain it all to you. We\\'ll tell you everything. Just sit down first. No. Charlotte\\'s dead. (Thud) Everything okay in there? What\\'s going on? - Oh, my God! - Ohh! Ohh! (Shivering ) Ohh! Ohh! Did he ingest anything? Uh, tea. He--he drank hot tea. Hey. His heartbeat\\'s irregular. - Hey. - Pupils dilated. Skin\\'s unusually dry. Right here. (Lisbon) Get that to the lab! In fact, extend the primary crime scene into the kitchen. No need for the lab. It\\'s belladonna, the devil\\'s cherry. I know it from working narcotics. Belladonna\\'s highly toxic. That\\'s why users dilute it with tea. The berries have a sweet flavor. They say it gives you instant hallucinations. (Patrick mutters) Well, if the victim was tripping, it would make him a lot easier to kill. Is he gonna be okay? He\\'s holding his own. That\\'s a good sign, but we need to get him to a hospital and pump his stomach. I\\'m gonna go with Jane. Cho, you\\'re in charge. You two push on the investigation. It\\'s okay. You know that Mendelssohn cut some of the rarest stones of his time? He was considered a master. You have his client list? (Chuckles) Yeah, you should see this thing. (Paper rustles) Leaders of industry, royalty, Hollywood stars. Yeah, we need to run them down. I\\'m all over it. I already have a call in to Clooney. Preliminary forensics report. There were no useable prints on the teapot or bowl. Well, except for Jane\\'s prints. Great. Smudging fingerprints, drinking evidence-- he\\'s like a drunk uncle. What about the electric saw that was used on the victim? Two sets of prints. One belongs to Mendelssohn, the other unidentified. M.E. puts time of death around midnight. Now Lisbon said the next-door neighbor heard Mendelssohn arguing with a man in his kitchen last night. Did Mendelssohn live alone? He was sharing his home with his daughter Melaina. Guess she hit hard times last year and moved in. She writes children\\'s books. Where was she last night? Big Sur. Rented a cabin to work on a book. I notified her this morning. She\\'s driving home now. Yeah. Definitely meet with the daughter. Okay. See if she knows who was at the house last night. - Right. Did the victim have any coworkers? An assistant named Julian Gallego. Bring him in. Let me know what you find. Mm. (Phone rings) It\\'s all right. I got it. CBI. Oh, yeah. Mr. Clooney. Yeah, this is Agent Cho. I just have a couple questions for you. (Police radio chatter, indistinct conversations) (Woman speaks indistinctly over P.A.) This way. This way, please. - All right, we\\'ll take it from here. - Is he gonna be o-- Viktor was like Stradivari. He could, uh, hear a flaw in the diamond by the way his grinding wheel changed its song. How long did you work for him, Julian? Four years. Who\\'s going to teach me now? There is no one like Viktor. When did you last see him? Yesterday. We spent the whole day in the workshop together. He was showing me how to open a window. A window? (Breathes deeply and sips) Before making the first cut, Viktor would spend weeks getting to know a rare gem. You have to, uh, polish a window in the cloudy surface of the stone so that you can peer into its heart. Sounds romantic. It is. A careless cut can shatter your treasure. Did your boss come into possession of any rare gems lately? Oh, yes. A 102-carat blue diamond. Most master cutters will turn into old men and--and never touch a diamond over, uh, 50 carats. 100 carats? How much is something like that worth? Well, it\\'s just a chunk of rough crystal now, but after Viktor was through with it... $20 million. And where is that diamond? Viktor took it home with him. He took all of his clients\\' stones home with him at night. He kept them close in a... hidden shoulder wallet. There was no shoulder wallet found on Viktor\\'s body. Did anyone have it out for your boss? Fahad. Fahad threatened him. Who\\'s that? Fahad Ranjani. Another diamond cutter. Uh, minor talent. The Blue Orchid is a career-making stone. Fahad thought it was going to him. The Blue Orchid? - Blue Orchid? - That\\'s right. When was your last contact with your father, Melaina? (Voice shaking) Mm... yesterday morning. I-I called him from the cabin. And he didn\\'t indicate that anything was wrong? On the contrary. He was so excited about that new stone. According to his assistant Julian, he liked to hide his clients\\' gems on his body? (Chuckles) Dad never took off that beat-up shoulder pouch. Even in bed. Drove mom crazy. And why would he do that? He was raised not to trust security services. His father was a German Jew who... survived the Holocaust only to have the bank steal the family money. And did anyone other than you and Julian know about the shoulder pouch? We\\'re the only ones he trusted. Melaina, are you a tea drinker? I am. (Pen clatters) We found a toxic substance inside your teapot. I don\\'t know anything about that. Excuse me for asking, but... can anyone confirm that you were in Big Sur last night? No. I rent a remote cabin for solitude. Would you consent to a forensics exam and an examination of your vehicle? (Voice breaking) No. I mean, go ahead. Do whatever you need to. You\\'re not real. You\\'re an hallucination. Depends on your point of view, I suppose. It\\'s the only reality that I know. (Lowered voice) How come I\\'m strapped down? \\'Cause you are strapped down. Yeah, they\\'re pumping your stomach right now. Listen. (Air hissing) (Man) Set suction at 125 intermittent. Check his I.V. and get me an electrolyte bag just in case. (Monitor beeping) Well, how about that? (Air hissing) (Man) A little more... So... you\\'re my daughter. Well, at least how I imagine my daughter to be all grown up. Do I meet your approval? You\\'re a bit lippy. (Chuckles) - Yeah, I get that from you. - Mm-hmm. Yeah. Sorry. I\\'m not really crazy about that. Hey, you didn\\'t exactly turn out the way I expected, either. What\\'s that supposed to mean? What happened to you? I\\'ve been dead for ten years, and you\\'re still stuck in neutral? You have no life, just this endless obsession. Red John. Red John. (Scoffs) Mom would not be happy. Well, my relationship with your mother is, uh... it\\'s my business. Show a little respect. (Scoffs) Hello, I\\'m a figment of your imagination. Show yourself some respect. This is what I\\'ve been missing out on for all these years? When do you go to college again? Look at you. You can\\'t even be real with someone who doesn\\'t even exist. Does anyone know who you are? (Monitor beeping) Yes. Who? Well, come on. Who? (Breathes deeply) Lisbon. (Swallows and sighs) Lisbon. Lisbon. (Indistinct conversations) Lisbon. Hey. Hey, Jane. - Hey, I\\'m back. - Yeah. You\\'re gonna be okay. They pumped your stomach. You took some kind of-- Hallucinogen. Hallucinogen. Mm. Was it in the tea? Belladonna leaves. Hmm. The doctor says it could take a few hours to leave your system. You\\'re gonna be okay, though. You just need some rest. Yeah. How you feeling? (Exhales) Parched. Really... so thirsty. Can you get me a little water? Please, belladonna? I\\'ll be right back. Okay. Bye-bye. (Woman over P.A.) Paging Dr. Statham. Dr. Statham, please. (Monitor beeping rapidly) Ah, Jane. Great park. (Sighs) You\\'re still here. You\\'re still tripping. It would seem so. Your really shouldn\\'t be driving. And you especially should not be driving an ambulance. Oh, that\\'s some strong tea. (Chuckles) Uh-oh. Now you\\'re stealing an ambulance? No. No, I\\'m just admiring the interior. Wicked G.P.S. How much you think one of these rigs goes for? You need bed rest. I need to go back to the crime scene. What\\'s her story? She have a boyfriend? Be quiet. I didn\\'t say anything. I was talking to the hallucination. In bed now. When I was in the victim\\'s kitchen, I made a breakthrough in the case. At least I thought I did. That\\'s about when the wacky tea kicked in. Fine. I will have Van Pelt come down here with crime scene photos. Not the same. I have to be there. Hallucinations are part of the subconscious. Mine could be clues. We\\'ll go when you\\'re lucid. Well, when I\\'m lucid, I could forget everything. But right now, let me tell you-- right now my visions are very, very real! In other words, you want to use drugs to solve a case. Some great minds did their best work on hallucinogens. - And now you have a great mind? - Ohh! I like her. Oh, yeah, funny. Double act, huh? Jane. You\\'re scaring me. Teresa, you can call me Patrick. Drugs is not the path I would choose, but it\\'s been chosen for me, so I must stay the course. Please, I implore you, take me back to the crime scene. The Maharaja of Jodhpur owns the Blue Orchid. His royal highness called personally to inquire about my services. The commission was mine-- until Viktor Mendelssohn used his flashy credentials to steal my job. I was told you threatened Viktor. I did. Did you kill him, too? (Speaks foreign language) Come again? It means barking dogs seldom bite. If I intended to kill Viktor, I wouldn\\'t broadcast my intentions. Well, things happen in the heat of the moment. Things we can\\'t control. Right before he was murdered, Viktor was overheard in his house arguing with a man about the Blue Orchid. What can I say? It wasn\\'t me. But you\\'re a barking dog, Fahad. You just said so yourself. Were you barking at Victor last night? What did you want from me? Do you want to arrest me? Then arrest me! If not, I\\'m going back to work! What do you have to say to that? ! You\\'re a person of interest, Fahad. Don\\'t leave town without notifying CBI. Did that sound like the man you heard yelling last night? It might. No, he didn\\'t sound-- I don\\'t think that was him. The man I heard yelling didn\\'t have an accent like that. (Clicks) Last thing I remember was admiring this beautiful butterfly. Right here. Real or imagined? Real, I think. Then I heard a bang in that pot there on the stove. What was in the pot? A rabbit. (Chuckles) (Lid closes) Like that rabbit? Yeah, just like that, but my rabbit was real, with a diamond necklace. That is some hallucinogen. She\\'s kind of cute. I mean, have you guys ever... You be quiet. Pressing on, I carried the rabbit to the foyer... and it jumped from my hands and hopped out the door. Then I moved down the walkway looking. \"Where\\'s the bunny? Here, little bunny, bunny.\" And I went through the gawking neighbors\\' and across the street. Right here I met this lovely Scandinavian couple that spotted the rabbit hopping up that path. They were Scandinavian? Yes. It\\'s a clue, right? Scandinavia. Reindeer. Reindeer, Christmas. I might have just figured out that the killer has a December birthday. Hmm. (Sighs) Did the couple you met kinda look like them? You must have walked by them on your way to the backyard. (Giggles) Classic. Still waiting for the subconscious clues to kick in, Jane. They will. Follow me. (Door creaks) This is wrong. What\\'s wrong? This yard\\'s different. In my hallucination, this was a... manicured garden with a... - Look at that pool! - Thing and a... This-- Okay, so tell me what happened back here in your vision. The water\\'s great. It\\'s where I met Charlotte. Charlotte? My daughter. Is that who you\\'ve been talking to? Yes. She here right now? Yeah. Wh-what is she doing? She\\'s doing the backstroke. I taught her that. Jane, maybe your subconscious didn\\'t send you any clues from the crime scene. Maybe it sent you your daughter. - Why? - I don\\'t know. Can we go back to the hospital now? - Workshop. - What? Charlotte took me to the diamond cutter\\'s workshop. Last stop, I promise. If we don\\'t find anything, I will tuck myself into bed and sleep it off. I\\'m gonna hold you to that. (Rigsby) Hey. (Clears throat) (Lock clicks) You have the key? Yeah, Mendelssohn\\'s daughter gave it to me. She said her father\\'s workshop was, uh, in the back here. And who are you? CBI. We\\'re investigating Viktor Mendelssohn\\'s murder. You\\'re his assistant? Julian Gallego. Uh, I work here. It\\'s not what I imagined. You mind if we take a look around? Not at all. I\\'m just packing up. Please. Thank you. - I like the other workshop better. - Shh. (Whispers) This is so dull. Why do even work for the CBI, anyway? (Lowered voice) You know why. To catch Red John. (Scoffs) Okay. Whatever. What does that mean? \"Okay, whatever\"? (Sighs) Well, to be honest, Dad, your obsession\\'s a little creepy and weird, you know What? I do it all for you. And your mom. Yeah. And I hate to be the one to break this to you, dad, but... there\\'s nothing that you can do for us. We don\\'t give a damn what happens to Red John. I mean, we\\'re dead. Gone. And you need to start dealing with that. I deal with that every day. Maybe that\\'s the problem. Could you please move? Don\\'t roll your eyes at me. Uh, you don\\'t need to go in there. That\\'s, uh, just my stuff. You found it. You found the Blue Orchid. Yes. In your stuff. What\\'s a $20 million missing diamond doing in your bag? Viktor\\'s daughter said he kept it on his body at all times. I-I don\\'t know how it got in there. Wait, you\\'re not accusing me? Viktor\\'s neighbor said she heard a man arguing with Viktor last night about a diamond. Was that man you, Julian? No. I mean... (Sighs) okay, yes. - Um, I was there. - So you lied to Agent Van Pelt? No. She never directly asked me if I was at Viktor\\'s house last night. You should have told her. How would that have sounded? That you fought with your boss, drugged him, stole his client\\'s diamonds, and then killed him. (Breathing nervously) We had a creative argument over how to shape this stone. We\\'re both artists, passionate. I didn\\'t kill Viktor. I idolized him. Turn around and put your hands behind your head. - What? - Do it. Hey! (Grunting) Well, that certainly was easy. Yeah, you\\'re just saying that because I found the diamond. (Chuckles) You wish. (Chuckles) (Breathes deeply) All righty then. It\\'s been real. Hang on. Where-- where are you going? Hello, I\\'m practically a grown woman. I don\\'t need to tell you where I\\'m going. No, yeah, I-- I-I know, but... You\\'re coming back. I love you, Dad. (Lisbon) Hey, Jane? No, not now. Wait. Julian\\'s in holding. The D.A. likes him for the case. Is Charlotte... Gone. Tea wore off. Oh. Well, you were right. Your hallucination led us to the killer. No, my imaginary daughter was right. It\\'s all too easy. What are you talking about? Well, I\\'ve never been to that workshop. I\\'ve never even met the apprentice. How would I know he was stashing stolen goods there? Who cares? You found the rock. That doesn\\'t mean we found the killer. We\\'ve got a match for the second set of prints on the murder weapon. They belong to Julian. Meh, you coppers and your evidence. You always let it confuse everything. Of course Julian\\'s prints are gonna be on his boss\\' tools. They were master and apprentice, right? You\\'re really serious about this? Yes. There\\'s something I am not seeing. Rigsby, where\\'s that necklace? What necklace? The one I handed you from the maid that found the body. The gardener found the body. Well... (Chuckles) means I hallucinated the maid. Why? Send myself a message. An eagle claw necklace. What are eagles? Don\\'t answer that. They\\'re hunters in the sky with excellent vision. Just after I... poured the tea, I was looking through the kitchen window, watching a butterfly, and I saw the bedroom of that, uh, neighbor lady-- what was her name? - Betty. - Betty. Yes. Her bedroom was on the second floor, up high, with an eagle\\'s view. How do you know it was her bedroom? She had lace curtains and blackout shades. Betty told me she couldn\\'t see the kitchen from her bedroom window. She lied. Okay. Play it cool. Okay. Hi! Ooh. How\\'s the, uh, investigation going? Well, to tell you the truth, uh, we\\'re a little stuck. Oh. Well, if I can be of any more help... There\\'s an idea. Oh, uh, uh, would you like to come inside? Only if there\\'s a cup of tea involved. I\\'d love a cup of tea. (Laughs) Sure. Come on. Come on. Oh, fantastic. We\\'re closing in on Viktor\\'s killer, but before we make an arrest, we need to find his client\\'s diamonds. (Gasps) The Blue Orchid. I\\'ve been following the news all day. Oh, no, w-we found that. The--the Blue Orchid was hidden in the, uh, bag of Viktor\\'s apprentice. Oh, so you have your killer? No. We don\\'t think so. (Teapot whistling) Oh. (Patrick) Uh, relax, I\\'ll fix the tea. Only a foolish killer would keep the Blue Orchid. It\\'s hard to move such a high-profile piece quietly. Oh, I see. (Whistling diminishes) A smart killer would use the Blue Orchid to frame an innocent man for murder and keep the small diamonds. They\\'re easier to fence, but still worth a couple million. Does anyone want, uh, lemon with their tea? - Let me top that up for you. - Thank you. There\\'s--there\\'s just one thing I don\\'t understand. Why don\\'t you believe that Julian killed Viktor? Doesn\\'t that make more sense, it\\'s more plausible, than somebody framing Julian? Framing him was the easy part. After Viktor was dead, all the killer had to do was take his keys, drive to his workshop, and plant the Blue Orchid in Julian\\'s bag. Well, if that was the easy part, what was the hard part? Uh, gutting Viktor like a fish. Oh, dear. Oh! - What\\'s wrong? - Oh, my goodness! Something is tickling my toe--oh, there it-- Where did--oh! Where did that come from? Uh, where did what come from? - The rabbit. - What rabbit? I have no idea. The--the rabbit! There\\'s a rabbit right here in my house! Where did it come from? (Speaking Scandinavian language) (Both speaking Scandinavian language) (Speaking Scandinavian language) Rabbit! Bunny rabbit, ohh. (Speaking Scandinavian language) Rabbit. (Makes chewing sounds) Ah-ha! Carrot. Mmm. (Laughs) What is wrong with you people? Why are-- Oh, no. Oh, My Lord. (Speaking Scandinavian language) Which--which tea did you serve me? Ja. Ja. Oh, lord. Oh, lord. Oh, lord. Oh, my God. No, no, no, no, no, no! No, no, no. I will not answer your questions. (Speaking indistinctly) (Cackling) I will not tell you what you wanna know. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. No. No, please. Let me go. Let me go! What do you got there? No! No, I need help! - Please! - Is that your shoulder pouch? No, I need medical help! Please! I just drank some belladonna! I need help! (Normal voice) You drank raspberry hibiscus. Sweet like belladonna, it doesn\\'t pack the punch. Believe me. But the--but the-- the--the rabbit... Local pet store. You tricked me. Ja, ja. Ah! (Speaks gibberish) Come on. Let\\'s go. You tricked me. Your finances are a mess, Betty. The money from your late husband\\'s insurance policy-- long gone. You couldn\\'t make next month\\'s rent. $2 million in stolen diamonds would have kept you living in style for a long time. What was he thinking? An old man walking around with all those jewels? He was begging for it. How did you know he carried them on him? Oh, please, I\\'ve known for years. His--his--his kitchen window\\'s right across from my bedroom. Every night I would lie in bed thinking, \"How can I get my hands on that pouch\"\" The Blue Orchid was your shot? Oh, framing Julian was one of, like, a dozen plans I\\'ve had over the years. The daughter was at the cabin, and when I saw the two of them in the kitchen with that big rock, I knew it was now or never. Once Julian left, I just--I went on autopilot. (Chuckles) Where\\'d you get the belladonna? I\\'ve had it for months for just such an occasion. All I had to do was drop in and offer him a pot of tea. (Laughs) The hallucinations made it easier to kill him? That was the original plan. But once I lifted the diamonds off Viktor, it... it--it was the craziest thing. He became so delusional, I convinced him to take his own life. What do you mean? How? I told Viktor that the diamonds were trapped in his stomach.

       "\"Curt Devlin, Express. Okay. Hi, Curt. I thought I left you in that bird cage at the office. What's a reporter without his cameraman? He's happy. I can get a swell picture.  I can put it up my sleeve.  The last time you did that you got a lovely close-up of your elbow. Now go away and hide someplace and play hermit, will you? Aw, Curt, have a heart. I haven't missed one of these clam bakes in years. Well, this is one you'll miss. Okay, okay, I hope when the dame sits down they blow a fuse. That's all I hope. Hey, you better have one. You look pale. I'm all right. What's that on your forehead, dew? Aw, shut up. What time is it? 11:35. Well, if this isn't a nice way to make a living. You don't think this Gaye dame will take on, do you? Oh, probably. The last one I saw screamed all the way to the chair. That's what I heard about dames. They always dramatize everything. It would have been a good idea if that dame had committed suicide before she got to the dance hall. Then we wouldn't have to watch it. No such luck. I don't know why they give me such assignments. I always get sick. Yeah? And I wish you'd stop eating beforehand. Never bothers me. Well, it does me. Hello, everybody. And how is everyone on this festive occasion? Hey, Devlin, did you bring a bottle? Where've you been, Dev? Haven't seen you for a long time. I work for a living. How are you, Devlin? Well, I'm a dirty so-a-so. That's what I always thought. What are you doing here, Garfield? Covering a story. Oh, thanks. Have a sandwich? Not me. I've attended these things before. You mean to say that Spike Kiley handed you out this assignment. Oh, I asked for it. You asked for it? Why not? It's a big story, isn't it? Look, tidbit, electrocution is no place for you. Well, I'm a reporter. No, you're not. You're just a sweet little kid whose family allowed her to read too many newspaper novels. You make me so mad I could.  Well, I could.  Spit! Go ahead. You think you're cute, don't you? You know, I'm surprised you don't talk baby talk. By the way, I don't suppose you've been to any of these high tension parties, have you? Well, there's always a first time. Yeah, but it always seems a little worse when they burn a woman. Why make an exception because she's a woman? Well, it could be a very interesting experience for you. Look, maybe I can give you a rough idea of how it looks. You know, just so you know how to handle yourself. Now, supposing this is the chair. Over there are the witnesses, that's us. Then they slap you in the chair like that, see? Then they put the straps across here… another here and another here. Then another one across here tight. Then they take a wide rubber band and put it across your eyes. Like that. And another one across your mouth. Then they take the electrode and they slap it on your leg, like this. Never mind the rehearsal. I was only trying to give you a present. That s a swell way to do it. Look, real gold and everything. You pick out the most appropriate places to get sentimental. Now, listen, little Miss Front Page.  It's okay for you to shag fires and ambulances. But a burning is different. It does something to you. It chews you up inside. Look at those guys. They've seen it before, and believe me, they're really tough. Don't go through it, kid. You don't have to. I'll cover the story for you. No, you won't. I was sent down here to see it and I'm going to. Come on, let me take you out of here. No.  If you can take it, I can. Oh, all right. Well, I guess it's about time for the slow music. We can go in now, boys. It's getting close. I don't have to tell you the regulations. You know them. Remember, it's different this time. Why couldn't they have given her life? I wish they had. Remember the last time we came through here? I couldn't sleep for a week. You wanted to join the parade, now keep in step. Baby, don't go through it. I'll cover for you. No one will ever know. Tough guy, eh? Hi, Herb, Hello, what's the trouble? Did a maniac drive by here doing 80? No, he didn't drive by, he drove in. And he wasn't doing 80, he was doing 85 and he ain't no maniac, he's Curt Devlin, which is worse. Is he parked in there? Yeah. Good. Open up. Hello, Burke. Hi, Ned. This is the car, all right. Swallow that tune, sonny, let's have your name. Sure. Toots O'Grady, press. Put it away. Before you start writing I should mention I don't own the car.  I wasn't driving and my hands are too cold to sign anything. Then how would you like to put your mittens on and drive this fire wagon into the station house where it's nice and warm? The trouble with that is I haven't got the keys. In that case you can get out and push it over to the station. Now that we've had our little joke you can write the ticket and I'll be on my way. You said it, Toots. Come on, get back there and start pushing. I thought you were playing. Climb in front. You drive and I whistle. We haven't got all night now, push him up. Would you mind releasing the brake? You think we should? Sure, why not? All way up, then. Step on it. Shift her into high. I've always wanted to travel this way. No noise, no vibration, no nothing. Goodbye, Barnes. Have a nice time. Where did you pick up the spare tire? Lovely night for driving, isn't it? Yes, step on it. Let's have a little speed. Did I ever tell you the story about my first wife? No. I'm lucky to have my motorcycle. Hey, what's the matter here? We've stopped. What's the matter with that guy? Hey, Toots. He disappeared. Look! Hey, are you down there, Toots? I don't know. It's too dark to tell. You better come on out of there or we'll come down after you. Swell. Watch out for the first step, it's 25 feet. You mean you can't get out? What do you think I am, a bird? Boy, I wanna get out of here and get some air. I'm hot and dry all over. Hey, you look pale as a ghost. Hey, Mike. Get this while it's hot. Believe me, it's hot. I gotta go right now, they're waiting. Under my byline. New York, written January 7th. The lights of Broadway did not flicker. But those of North Prison did as.  Mabel Gaye bravely sang her last finale. With a song in her lips, Mabel Gaye, Broadway's famous female Boniface At midnight she.  Hey, Joe, take care of the kid, will you? Somebody get her some water. Put her over on the bench and get some water. I don't know whether I can make this, but here it goes. Are you ready? I knew that daisy would wilt. Never mind, I'll cover. Pick up my stuff. Be sure and tell the night desk to rewrite it, otherwise we'll both have the same story. Okay. All right, let's go. With a song on her lips, Mabel Gaye, Broadway's famous female Boniface walked to the electric chair last night to expiate the murder of dapper Rudy Spade. As the auburn-haired beauty walked down the last mile Okay, Burt, take it out. . and the body of the once vibrant toast of the main stand will be taken today for interment in the family plot in the little town from where she came, Smithsville, Ohio. Ended. Add this to the night desk. Mike Conley, keep this under your hat, Garfield fainted and I covered. Give her a break, Curt. Okay. I feel all right. Thanks. It's okay, baby, I covered the story for you. But.  Don't worry, I took care of you. Thanks, Curt. I know how you feel. Come on. Mabel Gaye died singing. Not bad. That gal may make a newspaperman yet. Yeah, she may grow a full beard, but that ain't likely either. Here's The Express. Final Mabel Gaye dies singing. That's a hot one. Well, for the.  Do you see what I see? If you see the same story word for word in both papers, I do. Get circulation and transportation. Hello, Press Room? Kiley talking, hold your run, we're replating page one. Wait a minute. Circulation? Kiley, hold the guys. Transportation? Hold back your trucks. What? All right, get back what you can. Three trucks got away already. You know, this bit of female journalism is liable to land yourself on a cartoon magazine. You use the AP for the replates and get a sub for the new run. Sorry, chief, this came in with Garfield's stuff. I just found it again. Get the telegraph out. Spike, under your hat, Garfield fainted, I covered, give her a break, Curt. Oh.  I've been here 17 years but I knew it wasn't gonna be permanent. Hey, is he quitting? What do you care? You ain't working here anymore. AP? Oh, thanks. Kind of afraid around the edges, huh? Hm-hmm. If you were I would you ask me if I loved you? Hm-hmm. Well, do you, sort of? Not sort of, lots of. Would you pucker up and kiss a guy on account of? Hm-hmm. Just because of. I know a guy that's married. He likes it. What does his wife think about it? Well, she wishes he were twins so she could commit bigamy… and be twice as happy. Look, Curt, what do you think it would be like? Heaven, with all the modern conveniences. Gee, Ellen, why not? This business of being in newspapers won't do. That's kids stuff. You don't have to work. No, but.  I want to prove I can be as good a reporter as.  Now, look. We can get one of those studio apartments with a fireplace and… what else would you want? Are you listening to me? I was just worrying about that story. Don't worry about that. It'll be out on the street by the time we reach town. Don't interrupt me like that again. Now where were we? Read about it. Electrocuted girl. Extra. Morning edition.  Hey, boy, two of each. Showgirl electrocuted.! Read all about it! Girl dies singing! Mabel Gaye dies singing. Mabel Gaye dies singing. So you covered me. That fathead, Kiley. Hey, where are you going? So, you double-crossed me. What do you mean, double-crossed? I tried to cover you. Wait a minute. This isn't gonna do me any good either, you know. Hey, how are you gonna get home? The subway's still running. Not to where you can go, as fas as I'm concerned. Nice story, Garfield, both of them. Good morning to you. Lovely work, sister. You sure did a swell job with that one. You and that Express guy got a one track mind. Hello. I'd hoped you'd ended it all. Did I get you into terrible trouble, Spike? What Mr Johns said to me would make mule skinner's conversation with a factious beast sound like a baby's prayer at twilight. Oh, I'm awful sorry, Spike. You only started being sorry. Mr Johns wants to see you. Well, in every life some rain must fall. You're a cloudburst around this office. Come on. Do you mind telling me just how it happened that you and Curt Devlin had the same story word for word? What was it, a coincidence? Hey, Devlin, Mr Hartnett wants to see you. Funny, I had that feeling all morning. And now, buttercup, do you mind telling me what this beautiful thing is that's comes into your life and turns you into the Little St Francis of the press? Well, I just wanted to give the belle a break. And while you're giving her a break you give our circulation a compound fracture. It's getting so in use it gets into the Encyclopedia Britannica before we get it. All right, I said I was sorry and I'm not gonna get my eyes all red crying about it. So, what do I do? Go to work for The Star? That wouldn't be any change for you. You're working for The Star half the time anyway, covering up that sop sister. If you just look on your paycheck, you'll discover that The Express is paying you your salary. Oh, yeah, which reminds me. I was thinking about getting married and I thought a raise.  A raise? Maybe we better talk about it after the ceremony. A raise. Hello. Where have you been? In the sewer. What? In a sewer. What were you doing in a sewer? Nothing very constructive. Just keeping the rats company. Listen, Toots. Of all the places for a man to kill time, such as the movies, the aquarium and the library, you pick a sewer. It's very indicative of your character. I knew you'd feel that way about it, Curt, but it's just one of those things a man falls into. Think I'd better get home and take a bath. There's been threats. From whom? The Board of Health. It's a racket, I tell you. You can't make more than $70 unless you're an editor You know where the big dough goes, don't you? It's a swell story, you see what happens.  Hello. Imagine a picture like that.  You know my soft focus lens. And where do they put it? At the bottom of the Sunday ads section. And that's where it should be.  Hi, Devlin. Hiya, Nell. How's yourself? Toss you for a drink. Okay, tails. Two bourbons. Two bourbons. What'll your small boy have? He can have mine. See you later, you ol darling, you. Here you are, Miss. Wrap mine up for me, will you? Here, sonny, don't forget your drink. Don't go away. Here's mud in your eye. Make it beauty clay, you need it. Same thing, Jill. Hello, Garfield. I thought by this time you'd be out of the newspaper business and taking a course in Domestic Science. Curt, I found out that you really did try to cover me last night. You did, huh? I'm sorry. I should have believed you, I know. Do you think I'm.  well, do you think I'm sort of a rat? No, just a little mousy. Did you get fired? No, but I got a piece of Mr Johns mind. And I might tell you, it wasn't any present a gentleman should give a lady. What about you? Oh, my boss was quite pleasant, all he said was that he'd appreciate it very much if I would arrange a suicide pact with you. I guess we're in the doghouse, all right. Don't worry about it. I've been in the doghouse so long I'm commencing to bark at strangers. I'm not worried about you, I'm worried about myself, my job. In two weeks you'll be back covering the Dahlia Show. Are you going to start that again? Sure, why don't you marry me? I'll make a swell husband, even if I am a reporter. Now, look, I don't write novels or newspaper plays and take my hat off inside the house. Perfect. Don't forget, I'm a newspaper woman, too. Yeah, and don't you forget that women make rotten newspapermen. Is that so? Yeah. Look at Nell Bonnett. Let me see, Nell. If I could make a picture from this angle with my soft focus lens.  No, there's nothing you can do. You look at her. She makes me feel effeminate. Well, I don't, do I? No. I'm going to prove I'm as good a reporter as any man. Pecans. And what's more, I'm going to make you admit it. Almonds. I wouldn't marry you for anything in this world. Walnuts, both English and black. And the muffins I make.  Saved by the bell. That's a three-alarm. Well, the son of a gun, he's learned to count. Aren't you going to cover the fire? Sure, as soon as I have a glass of beer. Well, I'm going now. Say.  If it starts to go out, put a little kindling on it as soon as I get there. You're so smart. Ellen.  What do you want? You know what happens to girls who play with fire. What? They get burned. Oh, I was under the wrong impression. I thought.  Fire! Fire in the basement. Fire! Fire in the basement. Stop it, Stone, put that gun down, you don't know what you're doing. I know just what I'm doing. All right, you won't get away with it. Watch out, he's got a gun! Put that gun down, you don't know what you're doing. Listen to me, will you, please? Keep out of this.  You don't know what you're doing.  Keep out of this.  No, I tell you, no.  I'm sorry, Miss. But I'm a reporter, this press card says so. I'm not running the risk of letting any woman through these firelands. I don't care if you're a billygoat, you can't get through. Well, I'll be a billygoat if you want me to. If you're gonna be any kind of a goat, you'll be a nannygoat and you'll like it. Pardon me. Let us through, folks. Hello, Hallohan. Make way for mother's little lamb. How are you, Mr Devlin? And who's this poor young lady you've got with you? She says she's a reporter. She does? Well, she isn't a reporter, and what's more, she never will be. I'm every bit as good a reporter as he is. Oh, yeah, then let's see you get through these lines. There's nothing like an apartment-house fire to find a lot of guys whose wives think they're in Chicago. So keep that bird cage cocked and you'll shoot yourself a scandal. Don't worry about me, there's no smoke in my eyes. Think you can make it? There's only one way to find out. Come on. Take it easy. Officer, can you come here a moment? Hello, Mr. Stone. What are you doing here? Showing remarkably good sense by leaving a burning building. Will you see if you can get us a cab, please. I will, Mr Stone. Get back there. Where did she go? She slipped out the back way. Nobody saw her. Sure? I'm positive. Stop worrying, will you? All right. Here he comes now. What's the matter, Mr Stone? Nothing, just a lungfull of smoke, I guess. I hope you're all right. Thank you, officer. All right. Hey, go back on the curb, back on the curb, go on, now. Did you see the Express? I saw both of them. What's the matter with us? You know any reason why we.  Yeah, here comes the reason now. Good morning, Spike. Where have you been, and why don't you go back? What's the matter? Didn't you like my story about the fire last night? Oh, that was literature:  The hungry flames greedily licked the paint from the building.  That moved me, and how. The brave fire laddies darting about in the smoke looked like creatures escaped from Dante's Inferno.  That got me, too. I don't think my goose pimples will ever go down after that line. It was lovely, so sweet. I'll bet we've given a million readers pimples. You got everything there was to get for the story. Read The Express. Marvin Stone disappears after fire. Yes. Broadway producer missing after apartment house fire. Well, I'm a.  How do you suppose he got that? By being a newspaperman, dear. There are 200 fires in this town every day. But there's only one Marvin Stone. So what do you do? You describe a fire. You wouldn't know a story if it picked you on the air and you got lockjaw. If you could only spell I'd put you in the classified ads department. I've had drunken reporters, I've had reporters who coudn't read or write… but so help me, you're the only one I ever had that can have her throat cut and not know it even after she saw the blood. Oh, I'm sorry, Spike, really I am. You were sorry last time… and I was sorry for you last time, but no more. To me you're just another dame that's missed her calling. You ought to be writing poems on birthday cards. Oh, give it to me. I know I deserve it. I should have known better. Well, I'm gonna start running an office around here. Listen. Stone.  There was a Stone at the fire last night. Spike, I think I got a beat. You couldn't beat an egg. Give me 24 hours. I think I got something. If I had it my way, I'd give you life. If I don't come back with something this time, I won't come back. I hope. I should have fired her. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hold your horses. Stop that banging or you'll wake the dead. Hello. Say, listen, if you're gonna start that goat game.  No, this is important. So is my sleep. Have you read the morning paper? No, I sleep in the daytime. That is, I did until you came into my life. Well, Marvin Stone is missing. The police have checked everywhere. Stone.  Stone.  Oh, I saw him at the fire. I got him a taxi, a yellow. That's what I thought. Well, call them up and find out where they took him. I will. No, no, easy now.  All right, hurry up. It's very important. Give me a chance.  Can't you see it's important? I know, I know. Hello. This is Hallohan of the 5th Precinct. One of your men picked up a gentleman at the Granger Arms Apartments last night at 9:30. Dark coat and a gray fedora hat. Yeah, we want to know where the driver took him. Okay. What did he say? They're checking up. Who was the man with him? Never saw him before. Hello? Yes. Is that so? Okay, thanks. What? The driver took Stone to the Plaza Hospital. Well, come on, let's go. Not without me pants. All right. Wait a minute now.  Take it easy.  Stone? Just a minute, please, and I'll see. Stone, Stone.  I'm sorry, but there's no one here by the name of Stone. Wasn't there any man admitted around 10:00 last night? 10:00 last night? Yes, there was a man by the name of James Craig admitted at a 9:45. Is he still here? Yes, he's in room 702. Do you suppose that could be.  I don't suppose anything. We'll check up on him. That was room 70.  Room 702, 7th floor east. All right, thanks. Come on. We'd like to see Mr Craig. Mr Craig? Just a moment. This gentleman would like to see Mr Craig. I'm sorry to tell you. Mr Craig died ten minutes ago. Died? Of what? A stab wound in the abdomen. Have you notified the police? The detectives were with him until he died. Did he tell them who stabbed him? No. He never regained consciousness. I'd like to have a look at the body. Yes, I'll go with you. Hold it, you'd better wait here. All right. Thanks. Well? It's Marvin Stone, all right. My hunch was right. Hold on while I call the office. Has anyone else been here and inquired about this man? No. Is she a relative? No, no. I'm the one interested. I'm just working something out. Hello, give me the desk. Hello, this is Garfield. Spike, I've found Marvin Stone. He's dead. Looks like murder. Can you make it in the bulldog? Murdered, eh? Beautiful. I'll switch you to rewrite. Wait a minute.  I just remembered something else. Last night at the fire, Stone turned to the man with him and said.   Where is she? . And the mystery man answered.   She went out the back way. Nobody saw her.  A mystery man, a mystery woman, and a probable murder. Baby, you're doing swell. Now find the mystery woman. Marvin Stone dead of a stab wound. Entered hospital under an alias. By Ellen Garfield. It's a thorn in my side when I see you beaten by a woman. She pinned a rose on me, all right. You gotta hand it to her. Don't let her get you down, pal. I was one of those lovesick newshounds myself once… but it didn't get anywheres. It was purely platonic. She was a blister from Arizona. Indian blood. Lots of money and plenty of.  Devlin speaking. Oh, the moon of my delight. I wondered if you've been reading The Star lately. Yeah, there was an interesting article about Lydia Pinkham in the last edition. Oh, that yarn of yours. Well, that was just a lucky break. You stumbled over something and it turned out to be a corpse, that's all. I heard a noise distinctly like the crunching of sour grapes. You haven't got a story. All you got is a lead. The real story is digging up the unknown he, the unseen she and the guy who did the foul deed. And that's where I come in in my little quiet way. If I don't beat you to it. All right, if I turn up this murder, will you give in? Maybe. If you do. It's a bet. Crazy. Say, are you serious about this? Okay, it's a bet. It's a bet. Read about it in the Four Star. Mrs Devlin. Have you got any ideas? Boy, get me all the clippings on Marvin Stone. Yes, sir. Just roll that well enough alone. All right, next. Alexis Andre, 2000, Grant Avenue. Alexis Andre, 2000, Grant… say, what kind of name is Theodorosa Rosedick? Put it down. I get it, everytime we find a name we can't pronounce, that's what we're looking for. As far as I can find out, this fellow Stone has taken up with every woman in the world except Whistler's mother. You can look up the fellow's life for the past ten years and you'll only be half through the list. Got em down? I got two pages full. Put em in your pocket and come on. Aw, Curt, we ain't gonna look up all these dames, are we? You think I'm crazy? I wish you hadn't asked me that. Hey, Curt. What? Can we start this with a cup of coffee? I'm one of those pests from The Express. Could I bother you for a moment? I suppose so. The late lamented and punctured Mr Stone.  Know any tasty little details about him? I'm afraid I can't help you. He never regained consciousness and they've taken the body to the morgue. What about his clothes? His clothes are here. But I'm afraid they won't give you any clues. The police have removed everything from the pockets. Well, nothing will give you less information than a vacant suit. But I would like to see them if I may. Well, it's not regulation. Aw, just a little peek. All right, just a moment. Come along. No smoking, please. I know, I was just practicing. This way, gentlemen. Right over here. Here it is. Nice material, isn't it. He'd toast marshmallows on the candles around the coffin. Hmm, perfume. Can you imagine a guy spicing himself with a vibrant smell like that? That isn't a man's scent. You're telling me. Well, thanks. Say, Toots, it might be a good idea to take a picture of her. Might make nice human interest story, you know, the modern Florence Nightingale. Oh, really.  Oh, it's not a bad idea, come on. Right over here, now. Let's see, what color are your eyes? Blue. Both of them? No, not the down position, the up position. Oh, it thrills me. Now try to look like a cross between an angel and an ambulance going through a wreck. You cant fool me, you've posed before. You're so relaxed. Hold it! A beautiful subject. May I have one of the pictures? When you see it in the paper, just cut it out. Better get going, we're in a hurry. Goodbye. Yes, gentlemen, what can I do for you? Did Mr Stone ever have any suits made here? No, sir. Did you ever do any pressing and cleaning for Mr Stone before he shed this mortal coil. Before he what? Before he kicked the bucket. Oh, yes, I did. Several times. I was quite shocked.  Yes, I'm sure you were. Do you recognize this piece of material? Oh, yes, quite well. It's off Mr Stone's suit. I cleaned it the day Mr Stone was.  You did, eh? What time did you bring it to Mr Stone's apartment? I took it up to him myself that night at 8:00. The night he was stabbed? Yes, sir. At 8:00. And the fire was at 9:00. Yes, sir. Are you.  Are you a detective, sir? I'm beginning to think so. Much obliged. Come on, Toots. Would it be violating a confidence to ask you to tell me what we're doing? Smelling out a murder. Come on. I want to apologize for being so insistent upon seeing Mr Chinard. But I'm hot on the trail of something and I need an educated smeller to help me out. It's quite all right, Monsieur. How can I be of service to you? Will you take a sniff of this and tell me what you can about the perfume? It's a very fine, expensive perfume. Not a standard brand. It's an individual creation. Very feminine. Did you blend it? No, but whoever did is a very fine parfumeur. It's heavy without being soggy. It has a distinct personality. In other words, it might have been blended to reflect the personality of the woman wearing it. Undoubtedly. What sort of woman? Naturally, I cannot be certain. But it's the kind of perfume I would blend for very dark, decidedly Latin, type. That's the clue, dark, Latin type. Of course I cannot be certain about the Latin type. But I know the woman for whom this was made is a decided brunette. Well, thank you, Mr Chinard. I can't tell you how much I appreciate your sticking your nose into my business. Not at all. Well, I'll be on my way sniffing and barking after this dark, Latin type, Elisa. When I get her on ice, I'll guarantee you a feature story that won't do your business any harm. Mille fois, merci, cher monsieur. Thank you very much. Where to now? Hold your horses till I find out. You look like a canary who swallowed the cat for an owl. Why not? I just found out the mysterious she was with Stone the night he was stabbed. For the love of Mike, who told you? Who told me? Look.  The tailor cleaned that suit and brought it to Stone's apartment at 8:00, didn't he? Yeah. Coming from the cleaner's it couldn't have smelled of perfume, could it? No. The perfume permeated the clothes between 8 and 9. He was stabbed between 8 and 9 so the woman must have been with him, right? Right. How can I photograph a smell? Some of your pictures have come pretty close. Is that so? Yeah, give me that list of women. Here. Here, you take one of them. Go through the list and pick out all the French, Italian and Spanish names. Could you use a Swede? No. Too bad, there's one here. I got one. Inez Cordoza. I got one, Florabelle Martelli. We'll try her first. Hey, straight ahead. Right. Lovely day, or am I wrong? Are you Miss Florabelle Martelli? Oh, me no understand. Je ne comprend. Say oui and see what happens. Mademoiselle, est you Florabelle Martelli? Savvy? You know, Florabelle Martelli? Oh, one moment, Monsieur. Bill. What's the matter, Sug? There's a couple of slugs here trying to put the b on me. Oh, yeah? That's the first ape I ever saw with a shave. What's it all about? What's it all about? You tell him what's it all about. If we're gonna buy the building, we oughta find out who lives here. That's good, that's very good. Nice seeing you. Get outta here.  You're all right, doll, I saved you. Well, that takes care of Number One. Here we are. 306, Brenshow. This is what? 306, Brenshow. Good day, Madame. Is Miss Conchita Ranal at home? Who are you? We're friends of Miss Ranal. Oh, is that so? Well, maybe you'll pay me the forty bucks she owed when she scrammed to Hollywood last week. We don't know her that well. That takes care of Number Two. Brookhaven Apartments. No, sir, I'm very sorry. There's no bookmaker here. This must be the place. Yes, sir? Pardon me, I'd like to talk with Miss Marie Dacosta. Miss Dacosta? Why, she's been dead seven months. A perfect alibi. We don't wanna see her, then. No, that takes care of Number Three. That's right. Come on. Now listen, Joe… just because I go out with you socially is no sign I'm gonna introduce you to my friends, and that's that. I beg your pardon.  Forget it. It's forgot. Say, we're looking for some information.  Do you know.  No. Say, I didn't get in till 6 a.m. So what do I do? I turn up my eyes, hop into a new dress and I'm all right. How do you feel? Terrible. But I'll get okay. Say, I wonder if either of you two could tell me if Miss Inez Cordoza is about. Oh, Inez left the show about a month ago. And where is she now? She moved. I know that because I called her this morning to get the dope about her boyfriend's murder. They said she'd left. Oh, Stone was her little playmate, eh? Say, what are you, a detective? Aw, with a pleasant face like mine and dainty little feet like that? No, sister, I'm just a reporter trying to gather a few morsels on the Stone case. And if you girls can contribute any, I'll pay off with some good publicity. Oh, well, I'm Mae LaRue, M-A-E. Put that down, too. Okay. My name is Olive Wilson. Got that, too? Got it. Got it bad. Now, my beauties, tell me all you know about our little Inez. We don't know much, except that Stone was awfully crazy about her. She was for him, too. That is, until Coulter came along. Coulter? You know, Maitland Coulter, the bigshot polo player. You'd think he just got out of the Navy, the way he went for her. Well, I can't tell you how much good this does an old man's heart. By the way, Inez didn't leave an addresses or handkerchiefs behind her, did she? No, she took everything. Inez was like that. Oh, she left a slip hanging on the rack in my dressing room. But I don't see what good that would do you. Well, get it for me, will you? Sure. Did you see Mr Stone after he was dead? Yeah, but not to speak to. Was there much blood? How high was the blood, Toots? Oh, up to my knees… but then, I'm a tall man. Gee, I don't see how you reporters stand it. We usually wear boots. Here it is. Thanks. Hold it. Give it to me. The mysterious she is Miss Cordoza, Toots. Thanks, girls, be seeing you in the press. I'll fix you up a nice picture with my soft focus lens. I wish I had Inez in that slip, I could get a lot of good angles. Hello. Give me Mack. Mack? It's Curt. Hold the four star for a stop press. And get me a photograph of Inez Cordoza and Maitland Coulter. Yeah, get them at the morgue and send them down to Central. Have I got something? Say, listen. I've got a story that will curl the hair on an eggplant. Sorry, you'll just have to sit there and munch your nails for another half hour. Yeah, and then I'll be along with her. So long. Hi, Mr Devlin. Hello, Bill. Here are the photographs you sent for. Thanks. Well, how is the future Mrs Devlin? Fine, how is the disappointed bridegroom? Oh, aimless, just aimless. You don't need me for a minute, do you? No. That's what I thought. Have you seen the Lieutenant? Anything new? Not much. I can save you a trip in there, though. They found an automatic in the apartment, but no knife. The gun hadn't been fired. The houseboy testified that someone had been to the apartment about 8:30 just before the fire. I suppose you made some startling discoveries. No, I'm afraid you'll have to marry me out of love and not defeat. Maybe, but not till you admit I'm as good a newspaperman as you are. Let's call it a draw right now and not talk about it anymore. No. I made a bet with you on this Stone case and if you back out now you're a welcher. Will you have dinner with me tonight? Meet you at the room around seven. Listen… meet you at the room at seven. Bye. Bye. Well, by God, a monkey in a zoo has more privacy than I have. Hi, Chief. Hi, Lieutenant. Well, Devlin, what do you want? Is the negro houseboy and that flatfoot Hallohan around who saw the mystery man out of the fire? Yeah. Well, get them in. You wanna put on my uniform, too? Hello. Send Hollahan and that Johnson boy in here. Well? A girl by the name of Inez Cordoza and Maitland Coulter were with Stone the night he was stabbed. Coulter and Stone had been quarreling over the girl. The girl has disappeared. Is this one of your flights of fancy or are you talking turkey? If Hallohan and Johnson can identify this picture, I can prove everything. If they can, you've saved me an awful headache. If they can't, I'll give you one. Here you are, Lieutenant. There.  Stand right there and look at this. Who's this? That's the fellow I saw with Stone on the night of the fire. What about you? I don't know his name, but I've seen him. That's the man that asked for the number of Mr Stone's apartment the night of the fire. That's just what I thought. Hold him, I want to talk to him. All right, come on. Lieutenant, it's a pleasure to see you work. Thank you. Give me the Homicide Bureau. Mike, pick up Coulter. Suspicion of murder. Yeah, Stone. Wait a minute.  See if you can find a dame by the name of Inez Cordoza. Same charge. I haven't got a picture of her.  Yes, you have. Wait a minute. I was wrong, I have got a picture of her. Curt Devlin just gave it to me. I'll send it right over. Now you gotta do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink, but I won't read your darned Express. I want you to keep this mum until I get the story on the street. Yeah. Look in your pocket and see if you can find Inez. I'll look in my other suit. So long. I repeat, Lieutenant, smooth work, smooth work. Thank you. One look at this when it gets on the street and every editor in town will be picking up his pencil and sneaking out the back door. Do I get a bonus? Sure you do. How much? Oh, don't be mercenary. Besides, that's not my department. Well, do what you can. Every little bit counts. Well, I got a date. With that soppy over at The Star? Yep. Now, don't tell her anything. Will you please not? This is one time she won't get anything out of me. That's what Samson said the night before he woke up without his hair. Oh, well, so long. Hi. Hello. Two more. yes, sir. Gee, I like you. I'm sort of fond of you, too. I don't know why. Maybe it's because you remind me of an Irish Terrier I once had. Smart dogs, Irish terriers. Oh, this one wasn't. He bit me. All of which goes to prove that us Irish terriers will stand just so much. Which reminds me to tell you that you're all through playing newspaper. You're gonna get off that sheet and marry me. That's right, when you admit I'm as good a reporter as you are. Hey, listen, I'm sick and tired of humoring you. You're not a reporter and you never have been. You're just another dame hanging around a newspaper office getting in people's way. In fact, you don't even know when you've been taken to the cleaner's. So that's what you think of me. Yeah. Read that. All right. You win. Where are you going? You forgot to find Inez Cordoza. I suppose I'll have to do it for you. To women. They're what gods are to science. A pain in the neck. So I said, cold, but ladylike, I said.  Mr Trumbull, if you're trying to gild this lily, this lily is gonna put her shoes on and kick you right in the teeth. Come in, we're decent. How do you do? We do all right. I'm Ellen Garfield, of The Star. Another one, you're the seventh. Could you give me some information about.  Oh, we know, Inez Cordoza. Let's go into the routine, Mae. We don't know where she is. She moved when we called. Coulter and Stone had a fight over her. And all that she left here was a slip. A slip? May I see it? Sure. Dig up the slip, Mae. I'm getting a sore arm doing this. Thanks. Of all the slips Inez made since she was sixteen that's the first one you reporters have given any attention. Now this is going to be a help. What are you gonna do? Copy the laundry mark. How do you like that? Copy your laundry mark. That just goes to show you what publicity will do for you. Before Stone was dead she could have been tattooed and nobody would have copied it. Hiho! I found out that the police have a record of every laundry mark in the country. So it wasn't very difficult. Yes, Miss Garfield, this is one of our laundry marks. And you're very fortunate. It's a rush job and it's to be called for today. The perfect definition of a lucky break. Would you do me a favor? Certainly. Do you suppose we could arrange a signal? Let me think. What can we do? Wait for me, I'll be right out. Hey, wake up. Rip Van Winkle, wake up. What's the matter.  Yes, m'am. See that taxi over in front of the French laundry? Yes, m'am. When he pulls out, you follow him. And there's $10 in it for you if you don't lose him. For $10 I'd follow a cow on a Ferris Wheel. Get ready, here he comes. 48, Kingston. Hey, buddy.  I don't know whether you care or not, but that hack back there has been following us for the past eight blocks or more. Can you make out who's in it? I'm not sure, this mirror is pretty bad. Looks like a girl. Want me to lose him? No, pay no attention and go to the address I gave you. I could lose him so fast they'd think we vanished. Mind your own business and go where I told you. Okay, customer's always right. Say, what is this, a game of follow the leader? What are you talking about? We're following the guy ahead and there's a guy following us. It couldn't be who I think it is, or he would be in front of us. I hope you got a permit for this prey. I've got everything but a police escort. You know, Toots, women hand me a laugh. You take my little Ellen up there. She thinks she's putting one over on me. Yeah, cute little Ellen broke that Stone in the hospital story over you like an egg. I say, you never see the blood until your throat is cut. Say, Miss.  You want me to shake that guy behind? Shake him? If it's who I think it is, I'd like to shred hem. It's more important that you follow the car in front of us. You wait here. Hey, buddy, you can't park here, you know better than that. We know it.  Press. That's all I got. Move it Joe. Inez. Inez. Yes? Robert, what is it? What's the matter? Oh, nothing, I just hurried, that's all. What? Oh, I just dropped in for a minute, I.  I can't stay, really. Oh, yes you can, get in there. Please, don't point that. Robert, who is she? She's a fly cop, sis. You've got me all wrong. No, I haven't. Now you sit tight and keep your mouth shut or you'll go back to headquarters on a slab. I'm not a cop, I'm a reporter. You've got to believe me. I'm the only one that knows you're here. Won't you tell me your side of the story? I haven't any story and I'm not guilty. Then let me tell them if you're not guilty. Don't you realize every day your story goes untold the more people are convinced that you did kill Marvin Stone? You're just wasting your breath. Can't you see I'm trying to help her? Yes, you'll help her to the pen. Won't you believe me? Shut up, if you know what's good for you. Sis, if the newspapers are after you, you can't wait until tomorrow, you gotta leave tonight. What about the tickets? Don't worry about them.  I think I can get you out on a fruit boat. Here's your things, start packing. All right, I'll pack. Right away. You stay right there. And you're gonna stay locked up here with me until she's outside of the limit and well under way. Did you get it? Yeah. Let's go. So Inez is your sister. Yeah, what did you think? Is she is your sister, why don't you let me help her? I told you to shut up. That's right, you did, didn't you? Yeah. If it's not going too far, could a lady ask for a cigarette? On the desk. Thanks. Hello, Pier 108? Get me Mr Moorehead. Inez has good taste. What? I mean, I like the place. Get away from that window. You're just trying to fast talk her into walking into something so you can get a story or make a pinch, whatever it is. Hello, Phil? This is Bob Cordoza. Listen, Phil, you've got a fruit boat leaving tonight, haven't you? I want you to do me a favor. Yeah, I want you to take someone with you. The curtain! Quick, it'll set the whole place on fire. What? Wait a minute, I'll call you back. What's happened? What's the matter? Quick! All right. Okay, don't get excited.  How did it start? Robert? I guess it was that.  Now both of you stay where you are and do as I say. You're gonna tell me your story whether you like it or not. But I'm innocent, I tell you. Well, if you are, you're certainly playing it as if you were guilty. If you are, with this I can clear you in spite of yourself. I'm not kidding. This story means a lot more to me than just a newspaper story. Well, sis, I guess we gotta play ball with her. There's nothing else we can do. What time does that fruit boat leave? In about 45 minutes. Are you sure this Cordoza dame is coming down here? Positive. I've got the story all set up. As soon as Toots gets a picture of you making the arrest I'll get the plates in and be on the street in half an hour. Watch out for her and keep out of sight. Say, are you gonna leave that gal of yours up in that flat looking down the barrel of a gun all night? You're darn right. I'm gonna teach the future Mrs Curt Devlin once and for all that a woman's place is in the home. This story's gonna make you look awful bad. After tonight if anybody rattles a newspaper at her she'll run screaming from the room. Yeah, after you with a butcher knife. No, not her. She's a good sport. You know, we made a deal that if I topped her in this story, there'd be a wedding. Say, how'd you like to be best man? Well, I don't know what else I coud be. I'm too old for a flower girl. Here she comes. Get out of sight! What did I tell you? Boy, you oughta be a crystal gazer. Wouldn't he look keen in a turban? Get set. Use a match. No thanks, I don't smoke. There she is, boys. Come on. Bring her up the stairs. Turn around so I can get a shot. You're under arrest. Both of you. Wait a moment till I get a statement. Well, I'm a dirty so-and-so. A statement, gentlemen? Why, certainly. You may quote me as saying Mr Curt Devlin has put the long arm of the law on a sling. Miss Inez Cordoza was discovered by The Star representative and she will introduce her to the D.A. in the morning. To further substantiate my statement, you may read her exclusive interview in the latest edition of The Star. Reporter finds Inez Cordoza. So a woman's place is in the home, is it? The wrong dame, eh? And I was set for a big surprise. You got set and you got surprised. It worked out a little differently, that's all. Life's like that. It was a grand job and I'm proud of you. Well, I'm not. I feel as though I played sort of a dirty trick on you. Aw, forget it. It's a tricky business, tidbit. And you did all right. You're swell, Curt. Gee, I'm crazy about you. Honest? Honest. And I'm gonna cut your throat. Don't forget what went on under your chin tonight. Just luck. Oh, so when I do the top thing it's luck. But when you do it, it's because you're a topnotch reporter. When are you going to marry me? When you top me on this story, which means I'll probably die an old maid. Now listen! If Miss Cordoza wants to give you stories or pictures, that's her business. But you've got to wait. Thanks, Joe. Okay, Miss Garfield. Now, listen. When the D.A. questions you just as you were all the other witnesses today tell him the truth. There's no use trying to protect Coulton because you don't know anything. The most important thing to do is take care of yourself. I suppose so. Anyway, I'll do as you say. You've been awfully kind, Miss Garfield. Don't worry, it's not entirely unselfish. I want this to be an exclusive story. Promise me you won't say anything to those news belchers out there? All right. The story is mine and I mean to keep it that way. Will you step in now, Miss Cordoza? I'm sorry, I can't let you in on this. You'll have to wait out here. Oh, I can't stand it. Miss Cordoza, Mr Devlin. How do you do. Sit down, won't you, please? There's a cigar in the humidor, Curt, help yourself. Thanks. Thanks. Now, Miss Cordoza, I want to know just what happened on the night Stone was murdered. You're on the Coulter case, aren't you, matron? Yes. Will you come in so we'll fix up your card? Listen, Joe.  You gotta do me a favor. Take me in that room with you. You're out of your mind. You know I can't do that. Joe, it's a matter of life or death. Nespapermen are bad enough, but newspaperwomen.  Listen. I'm out for promotion. Well, you're talking to just the right girl. I've got a friend that will fix it up with Chief Nelson. You'll have gold stripes in your sleeve in a month. I can't do it. You just got to, that's all there is to it. And then? Go on. Well, I went to Mr Stone's apartment for dinner. When I arrived, Mr Coulter was there and Mr Stone was ill. The room was in disorder and there were signs that there had been a struggle. I asked questions but they passed them off by saying Mr Stone had been ill all day and he'd been drinking. He often drank too much. And he had a violent temper so I said nothing more about it. Stone seemed to be suffering a lot but he wouldn't let us call a doctor. He said he'd be all right and while we were arguing fire broke out. Naturally we got out of the building and Coulter put Stone into a taxi. That's all I know. Everything, I swear. Why didn't you come here at once? I was afraid Coulter might be drawn in. He's in all right. Up to his neck. But he's innocent, I tell you. Innocent. Don't you see that he is? Please, Miss Cordoza, no hysterics. You may go now. The matron will stay with you until the trial is over. Send in the Japanese houseboy, will you? Yes, sir. George, will you help Miss Cordoza through that line of reporters? With pleasure. Thank you. This way, Miss Cordoza. Hold it! Thank you, Miss Cordoza. A beautiful soft-focus picture. You have no right being in here. Take care of Miss Cordoza. Those guys would photograph a hanging. Well, that didn't help us much. No. How do you do, everybody? Hello, Fuji. Fuji, are you sure you don't remember seeing a knife the day after the night Mr Stone was stabbed? I no see knife. Even when I remember with my imagination. Tell me exactly what you did the morning after the fire when you came into Mr Stone's apartment. Women. Be quiet. I don't want to miss a word of his testimony. First I open door. Then I say: tsk, tsk when I think Mr Stone has been drunk again. Then I reach down, pick up mail on the door. Go to kitchen to cut open the envelope both side and top like Mr Stone like envelope cut when he read in the morning. Then I notice sand, ash and blood in pieces on floor. I get the vacuum and suck up. Then I get the breakfast Put it and letters on tray and knock on Mr Stone's sleeping door. He no answer. I open, he no in bed. I sit. Pretty soon, boys come say Mr Stone he shot in his stomach with knife. All right, Fuji. That's all. Thank you very much. Thank you. Thank you very too much. Thank you. Thank you very too much. We're in for it. We can indict Coulter. He's laying out. But we're gonna have the devil's own time convicting him. Why, it looks like an open and shut case. Open and shut, my hat. Stone was stabbed and the jury is going to wanna know with what. A man who brings a gun to commit a murder doesn't bring a knife, too. A man who thinks to bring a knife wouldn't forget and leave his gun in the middle of the floor. To build this case, we've got to have exhibit A. The instrument with which the murder was committed. And we haven't got it. And if you don't find it, the defense will nail your hide to the courtroom door. If there's anything I can do, you'll let me know, won't you? Thanks. I'll see you later, Devlin. Why, hello, Miss Garfield. You know Mr Devlin? He's helping us with this case. And thanks for your cooperation, too. Oh, I'm always willing to cooperate. In fact, as you're up for reelection, do send me a handful of your campaign buttons to hold up my little brother's trousers. Cute, isn't she? There you are. You know when you smile like that you look like a very sick cat? Sorry, tidbit, but I seem to be able to get in everywhere. So can a Jersey mosquito. But they make better company. You're wrong, tidbit. Sorry I couldn't include you in that conference, but you know.  Don't you worry about me. I don't think I missed very much. Well, you never can tell. What are The Star's views? Well, we think the D.A. is going to have a very hard time getting a conviction without that knife. That and the fact that Inez testified that Stone was ill when she got there suggests a third party. And a reasonable doubt, which I have a hunch the jury will give him the benefit of. Very good, but er.  Well, I guess the longer you're associated with me the smarter you get. By contrast.  Yeah, listen.  I was gonna cut you in on something, but.  That sounds like bacon for some other sucker, not me. Well, it sounds like a crazy hunch, but supposing that knife is still in Stone's apartment. But they've been over it with a fine-tooth comb. Yeah, but you know, a cop's idea of a fine-tooth comb is a rake. It sounds crazy, I know.  But you can't be serious. There isn't a chance they'd overlook a thing like that. Yeah, I guess you're right. Just another good hunch gone wrong. Yes. Say, I got that Cordoza. Next car, please. Oh, I'm sorry, I can't ask you in. I popped her just as she came out. What a picture. One of those Toots specials. Never saw anything like it.  Excuse me. Could you tell us where the Marriage License Bureau is? Ask him. Pardon me.  Could you tell.  Scissors, but no knife. Fuji said when he came in here that morning he went out to the kitchen to get a knife to open the mail. Why? Because the paper knife was missing. Stone was stabbed with a paper knife that was supposed to fit in here. That's why we're opening this bronze bagpipe here? Exactly. Go ahead and open it. Fuji said he used that thing to clean up the morning after the murder. It looks like you're out of luck unless I can interested you in some sand. Sand… say, how do you suppose that got in there? Maybe Fuji used this to clean the spillage. If he uses that thing to clean up here, he probably uses it to clean up in the hall also. Come on. I never get a break. How're you gonna photograph a missing knife? Anybody that can get in places as easy as you can couldn't possibly have come of honest parents. I should argue with the superintendent. Come on. Grab this and let's take it inside. What are we gonna do now? Play in the sand? If I had known of this, I'd have brought along a bucket and a spade. There, let's dump it here. Reminds me of the beach I went to one Sunday. Okay. Now, let's see. There she is. For the love of Mike. This innocuous little instrument, my friend, will give the D.A. a thrill and Mr Coulter the shock of his life. Some shock, about 2,000 volts. I can feel us going up for burglary, this is plain. Well, fancy seeing you here. Well, I was just passing by. I knew you'd be here. Yeah? By the way… the next time you pick a lock, please remember to take out the hairpin. It looks neater. You might have left some fingerprints. Oh, I see you've been house cleaning. Did you find the knife? No, tidbit. If there's a knife in this apartment it would take Lady Macbeth to find it. I told you so. Just another good hunch gone wrong. That only goes to prove we can't have everything. Couldn't we get out of here before we have to explain something to somebody who might be disagreeable about something? That boy has a very good idea. Will you tell me how you got in here? Not with a hairpin. Good morning. Good Morning, big-hearted. Little feverish this morning? After you cut me in on that story yesterday? Oh, no. If you were half the newspaperman you thought you were yesterday, you'd have the same story I did today. Why don't you build yourself a statue and hold services every Sunday? Say, are you sure you're gonna marry that dame? Positive. I don't think she is. Here ye, here ye. This court is now in session. On the night of the fatal stabbing Coulter called upon the deceased and quarreled with him. Hence, we have opportunity. Coulter, a man who never before had been known to carry a revolver carried one that night. Because, gentlemen, there was murder in his heart. True, Stone was not shot, he was stabbed by a paperknife within easy reach on a table. Swell angle. The next day the gun was found on the floor. The room gave evidence of a struggle and the paperknife was later found in an ice receptacle. Why? Gentlemen, because this is what happened. There was a quarrel, Coulter drew his revolver, in the struggle Stone knocked it from his hand to the floor then Coulter snatched the paperknife from the table and plunged it into the man he hated to commit the crime for which he came. Murder! Gentlemen, premeditated murder. A crime of which the people demand you find him guilty… in the first degree. The Court is adjourned. You think they'll convict him? Take it easy, boys, take it easy. I got some swell stuff, Curt. I got a soft-focus angle of him that's terrific. Shut up. Well, I'm just interested in my work. Hey, give me the desk. This is Devlin speaking. Get this. As the jury file passed, Maitland Coulter's eyes peddled each member for his life On the face of one he saw pity, on the face of another condemnation. All the rest were enigmatic. What were behind those ten faces? Freedom or the electric chair? And listen.  Rewrite that while you're whistling Hearts and Flowers softly and you'll get the idea. So long. Have the doors closed behind the jury? Period. Paragraph. Come on, I got something on my mind. There are two ps in opportunity.  Some day I'm gonna buy a flit gun and shoot you dead. I think I'll cut you in on something. The way you did yesterday? No, thanks. Sure? Positive. Okay. Hey, Toots, ask your camera to come along and bring you. We may need a tripod. Funny, huh? Better come along, I'm sure I got something in the bag. I know that bag. I held it yesterday. Close the door. What game are we playing now? Broom closet, that's it. Something tells me this is the beginning of something that's gonna end up in trouble. Come on, let's beat it. Say, what the.  You stay here and try to look nonchalant. Guilty. Guilty. Not guilty. Guilty. Not guilty. Not guilty. Not guilty. Not guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Seven to five. Gentlemen, we now stand 7 guilty, 5 not guilty. He's guilty! The judge said if there was a reasonable doubt.  Reasonable doubt? There's no doubt in my mind but that he's guilty. He was there. The night. The gun. Now listen. I won't be influenced, gentlemen. I'm trying to do the right thing. Wait a minute. Who are you? The janitor. Just what I've been looking for. What a man! What a man! The most interesting profile I've ever seen. I'll put your picture in the Sunday papers.  The Man Behind the Broom . Hold it! You're gonna take my picture? I got it. You wanna take a nip? Sure. Thank you. Skol! No, no, the light's bad in here. Let's go out in the fire escape where there's a beautiful background. The stars, the moon.  But it is dark out there. All the better. If that jury don't come in soon they'll forget what they went out for. Maybe they've escaped. Somebody oughta go and find out. If that fathead Devlin hadn't dug that knife up, the jury would have brought in the verdict not guilty and we'd all be home in bed by now. Aw, give him a break, maybe the guy ain't guilty. This is Hedley. No, they're still out. Yeah, just a minute. Oh, Garfield, that nice man you work for is on the phone. Thanks. Hello, Spike. What? How could he? He's not a mind reader. Sure, I'm watching. I don't know. Okay. Well, I'm a.  What's the matter, babe? Devlin cracked the story in his two star that the jury on the ninth ballot stands ten to two for conviction. Oh, he's crazy. Sure, there's no way he could find out. That guy's gonna get himself in a sling crack with those fake stories. How would he dare d a thing like that? That guy would dare anything. Guilty, guilty, not guilty, guilty. Eleven to one. Gentlemen, we now stand eleven guilty, one not guilty. Can't you see, now? For the love of Pete. Are you gonna hang out forever? I'm doing my duty as I see it. I don't want to convict the man unless I'm sure. Now remember, you're a man of moods. This time you're dramatic. Hold it! This time you're happy. Hold it. Come in. Well, well? They're still out, sir. Then I'll go across the street and get a bowl of soup. I'd be glad to get it for you, Your Honor. Oh, no, thanks. I need a breath of fresh air myself. And you let me know if those fellows make up their minds. Yes, sir. Do you realize how long.  Will you please come on, popcorn. You can't hold out forever. All right, all right. Have it your way.

They just went in. Good. Come on. I got an idea. What are we doing now? Find a waste basket and put all those ballots in it. What for? Manufacturing a news piece for Garfield. Oh, phony ballots, huh? Leave the door open. Now act mysterious and don't notice anything. Now you take the old Egyptian tapestries. The weave is what mattered. Unlike the modern artist, the old masters always took their time. Not guilty. Not guilty. Three.  Say, what's going on here? Now, that's exercise number one. Number two.

You two are gonna be happy together, I can see that. Yeah.  Bailiff, bring that fellow Devlin into my chambers. Yes, sir. Beg your pardon, Devlin. The judge wants to see you. Let me know what the visiting days are. Hello, give me the desk. This is Garfield. Hello, Spike? Spike, I steered you wrong. Coulter's guilty. What? Coulter's guilty? Well, I'll be a.  Why, you.

Call Stacey and kill the whole page. Something's happened. Stop everything. Hello, Henderson. Stop the final. We're replating page one. Don't move a thing until I call you. Transportation. Hold your trucks. What? We're on the street with a bum steer. Grab cabs. Buy every Star you see. This is the biggest bloomer that's ever been pulled. There you are. Now start at Larkin Street and pick up every final with a Not Guilty banner. Grab cabs, now step on it. Remember, here, you fellows over here, start at Larkin Street and work South. Here you are, come on, now. All of you. There. Step on it. What's this? Well, you're quitting, ain't you? Get out of here. Hello. Oh, it's you. Spike, I don't know what to say. Well, I do. You're fired! Extra Paper. Read all about it. Star! Coulter not guilty. Read all about it. Coulter not guilty! Give that to me. What are you trying to do? All right, son, I'll pay you for these.

It's all right, Spike. If there's one more copy of The Star left on the street.  I'll eat it. Extra! Extra! Star Paper. Coulter not guilty! Extra! Extra! Coulter not guilty! Extra! Here you are. Thanks. Here's your change, Miss. I took out for all three. Okay, keep it. Thank you. Waiter, bring me an old-fashioned, will you, and hurry up. Make it two. Oh, hello. Hello. Two old-fashioned, Joe. Do you mind if I join you? I'd like to get drunk, too. No, I don't mind. I'm sorry for you, Inez. It's tough, I know. They're so wrong. He didn't do it. Well, buck up. What have I to buck up about? He didn't do it, I tell you. He didn't do it. Well, all right, all right, so what? Waiter, bring us two more old-fashioned to the table over there. Yes, miss. Come on. Let's sit down. It's awfully uncomfortable here. Okay. Two more old-fashioned, Joe. The Express won't assume any responsibility. You brought this down on yourself, now let's see you get out of it. I wash my hands of the whole matter, and so does The Express. Great work, kid, congrats. Now, don't worry, we'll spring you. And there's another raise in this for you. Yeah? Sure. Mr Hartnett, at least you oughta get me a lawyer. Get your own lawyer. Say, did you have anything to do with that Lulu that came out in The Star? Ha-ha, that Lulu was my idea. Good work. You certainly made a sap out of that dame. She's no sap. Shhh. In fact, she's the best newspaperman I know. And I'll tell you something else. If she gets fired off The Star, you'd better hire her because if you.  Here she comes. I'll see you later. Hello. Hi. Well, look who's here. Aha, and look who's in there. I'm sorry to have tripped you up in that yarn. But after all, you should have known better than to fall for that stuff. You needn't rub it in, Curt. I'm all washed up as a newspaperman. Fired? Hm-hmm. Oh… do you really mind? No, I guess maybe you're right. It isn't any job for a woman. Sure, women are bad newspapermen. But not too bad, you lug.  I killed Stone , Inez Cordoza. Showgirl, fiancée of Coulter, confesses fatal stabbing. Say, what did.  Just after the verdict I ran into her in the Café. She was shot to pieces so I went to work on her. It wasn't very hard to break her down. The story is briefly this. Stone was about to kill Coulter. So Inez stabbed Stone in order to save her sweetheart's life. But the knife. Those were men's fingerprints. She had on an evening dress. Long black gloves. The minute that Inez stabbed Stone, Coulter grabbed the knife out of her hand. Then they heard the fire engines. You'll read the rest in The Star. For the love of Mike. Say, that's the way to work. That's being a good newspaperman. Do you really mean that? Well, I hate to admit it, but I do. Oh, that's all I wanted to hear you say. Here. Garfield's last stand. Hold it! You can cut out that silly stuff now. I got the picture. Well, that takes care of both papers.
